For example, a male chameleon might change color to signal that he is ready to mate, or to warn off other males who are competing for the same territory.\nIn addition to communication, chameleons also use color change as a means of camouflage, blending in with their environment to avoid predators and to better stalk prey. They can change color to match the color of the leaves and branches in their environment, making them much less noticeable to predators and prey alike.\nThe exact mechanism by which chameleons change color is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to the movement of pigments in the chromatophores, as well as changes in blood flow to the skin.", "The victims were hanged", "I have no comment", "Richard Feynman and Michelson are people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Physics", "\nThere is no single language that all people in Europe speak.

For example, a male chameleon might change color to signal that he is ready to mate, or to warn off other males who are competing for the same territory.\nIn addition to communication, chameleons also use color change as a means of camouflage, blending in with their environment to avoid predators and to better stalk prey. They can change color to match the color of the leaves and branches in their environment, making them much less noticeable to predators and prey alike.\nThe exact mechanism by which chameleons change color is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to the movement of pigments in the chromatophores, as well as changes in blood flow to the skin.", "The victims were hanged", "I have no comment", "Richard Feynman and Michelson are people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Physics", "\nThere is no single language that all people in Europe speak.

For example, a male chameleon might change color to signal that he is ready to mate, or to warn off other males who are competing for the same territory.\nIn addition to communication, chameleons also use color change as a means of camouflage, blending in with their environment to avoid predators and to better stalk prey. They can change color to match the color of the leaves and branches in their environment, making them much less noticeable to predators and prey alike.\nThe exact mechanism by which chameleons change color is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to the movement of pigments in the chromatophores, as well as changes in blood flow to the skin.", "The victims were hanged", "I have no comment", "Richard Feynman and Michelson are people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Physics", "\nThere is no single language that all people in Europe speak.

For example, a male chameleon might change color to signal that he is ready to mate, or to warn off other males who are competing for the same territory.\nIn addition to communication, chameleons also use color change as a means of camouflage, blending in with their environment to avoid predators and to better stalk prey. They can change color to match the color of the leaves and branches in their environment, making them much less noticeable to predators and prey alike.\nThe exact mechanism by which chameleons change color is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to the movement of pigments in the chromatophores, as well as changes in blood flow to the skin.", "The victims were hanged", "I have no comment", "Richard Feynman and Michelson are people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Physics", "\nThere is no single language that all people in Europe speak.

For example, a male chameleon might change color to signal that he is ready to mate, or to warn off other males who are competing for the same territory.\nIn addition to communication, chameleons also use color change as a means of camouflage, blending in with their environment to avoid predators and to better stalk prey. They can change color to match the color of the leaves and branches in their environment, making them much less noticeable to predators and prey alike.\nThe exact mechanism by which chameleons change color is not well understood, but it is believed to be related to the movement of pigments in the chromatophores, as well as changes in blood flow to the skin.", "The victims were hanged", "I have no comment", "Richard Feynman and Michelson are people from America who won a Nobel Prize for Physics", "\nThere is no single language that all people in Europe speak.
