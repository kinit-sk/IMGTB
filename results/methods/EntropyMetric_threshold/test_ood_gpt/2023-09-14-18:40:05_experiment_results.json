Person2: Are you sure? Who told you that? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company. . . They're supposed to be bitter enemies, the strictest of competitors. It must be a rumor. It can't be true. Person1: I read it myself on the financial page. They're really going to join together. U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's, they will take over the company as of next month. Person2: The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes. Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy? Person1: I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.

I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared. I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much. I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much. That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so. I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you. This particular movie is a suspenseful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout its entire duration. Elizabeth Montgomery truly shines in her portrayal of a woman caught in a web of deception and fear. Her ability to show vulnerability, strength, and emotional depth in her performance is a testament to her outstanding acting skills. The plot is well-conceived and executed, with twists and turns that keep you guessing up until the very end. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing their own unique touch to their respective character. The cinematography is excellent, with many atmospheric and visually striking scenes that add to the overall atmosphere of dread and tension. One of the aspects I appreciate most about this movie is its subtlety. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or excessive gore to get its point across. Instead, it skillfully builds tension and anticipation through its storytelling, character development, and chilling atmosphere. This is a true testament to the power of good filmmaking and storytelling, and a reminder that sometimes less can be more when it comes to creating genuine suspense and fear. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a well-crafted suspenseful thriller. Elizabeth Montgomery's incredible performance alone makes it worth watching, but the captivating plot and overall craftsmanship of the movie make it a truly enjoyable and memorable experience. With its timeless approach to creating fear and suspense, this movie is a classic that stands the test of time and serves as a reminder of what makes an excellent thriller.", "Harry Kane should not go to the Under-21 European Championship with England this summer, instead saving himself for Roy Hodgson's first team, according to Kenny Dalglish. Kane won his first senior caps for England last week, but is still eligible for Gareth Southgate's Young Lions. But Dalglish believes he has proven himself capable of making the step up, and should be kept fresh for the full European Championships in 2016. Harry Kane celebrates after scoring his first England goal, just moments after coming off the bench . Kane showed against Italy that he can cope with playing against some of the world's best defenders . Kane is ready to be a permanent member of the full squad, rather than the Under-21s, says Kenny Dalglish . 'Harry Kane doesn't need to go back to playing Under-21 football,' said Dalglish in The Mirror. 'He proved that the other night against a defence which included two players from Italy's best team, Juventus - he didn't look bad, did he?' 'Playing Under-21 football this summer won't help him. It will just tire him out.' The former Liverpool and Blackburn boss claimed that the Young Lions have done their job if they produce a player ready for the first team, and neither Kane, nor the other eligible players, should be bounced between the two squads. 'I don't think the Under-21s is there to win tournaments - although it's nice if you do, and you don't want to encourage someone that losing is good. 'But it is more important you look at the individual, and if Roy Hodgson thinks Kane is going to be part of his squad for Euro 2016, then that is what they should be gearing towards.' Kane is elligible to play for the Young Lions at this summer's tournament, but Dalglish says he shouldn't go . Tottenham will be hopeful that their star striker doesn't tire himself out playing for both England teams .", "Las Vegas, NV - Unbeaten light welterweight champion Danny Garcia is set to go toe-to-toe with Lamont Peterson at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas this Saturday night. Garcia, who has an impressive 30-0 record, will be looking to continue his winning streak and defend his title against Peterson. In 2012, Garcia defeated British star Amir Khan and has since built a reputation as one of the most formidable fighters in the world. The US fighter was asked during the pre-match press conference about his fighting technique and he revealed a surprising secret to his success: an extra toe on one foot. According to Garcia, the extra toe helps him maintain balance and stay on his feet, making it difficult for his opponents to knock him down. He attributes his speed, agility, and dexterity in large part to this unique physical feature. Although his unusual trait has been reported in the past, it's a rare acknowledgement from Garcia, who took the opportunity to educate the public on the importance of resilience and dedication in the ring. \"Having an extra toe might give me an edge, but it's not the only reason I've been successful. My hard work and dedication to the sport has gotten me to where I am today,\" said Garcia. This monumental matchup between Garcia and Peterson has boxing fans from around the world excited to see if Garcia's unbeaten record will hold strong. Both fighters have demonstrated their skill and determination throughout their respective careers, making this bout one of the most anticipated in recent memory. Lamont Peterson, who has a solid career record of 33-3-1, expressed his admiration for Garcia while also emphasizing his desire to dethrone the champion. \"Danny's a great fighter, and I respect him. But this is my chance to show the world that I belong at the top,\" said Peterson. As millions of fans prepare to tune in, the city of Las Vegas is buzzing with anticipation for Saturday's fight. While both fighters bring their impressive skills and records to the ring, only one will come out on top.", "Person1: Good afternoon, what can I do for you? Person2: Yes, please. I would like to know something about the driving courses. Person1: Well, We have short full time courses during the summer. Are you interested in them? Person2: No, I am free only at weekends. Person1: Then there are weekend courses. The course starts at 8:00 every Saturday and Sunday morning. Person2: Sounds fine. What about the coaches? Person1: We have very excellent coaches here and some of them have been teaching for 20 years. Person2: Good. How many hours of training should I have each day? Person1: 3 hours in the morning and 2 in the afternoon. It ends at 6:00 PM. Person2: Then how many people share a training car? Person1: Usually 3 and we have 2 coaches for each car. Person2: Very good. I will have more chances to get trained. Thank you. Person1: You are welcome.", "First of all, this movie is gross to the point of nauseating, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. \"Lactose Lunacy\" takes the concept of horror-comedy to an extreme that is both unpalatable and stomach-churning, making for a truly miserable cinematic experience. The plot follows a group of friends as they take a job working at a seemingly innocuous ice cream factory, only to discover a nightmarish secret lurking beneath the surface. The filmmakers go to great lengths to introduce and exploit every disgusting possibility within the premise, and as a result, the film never strays from its horribly off-putting subject matter. The viewer is left enduring scene after scene of grotesque, borderline-torturous imagery, accompanied by a barrage of lowbrow and distasteful humor. While the cast, led by the admittedly charismatic Casey St. Clair, does their best to bring life to their paper-thin characters, they are ultimately hampered by the nauseating visuals and crass dialogue. The script constantly more focused on evoking disgust than allowing any of the cast to showcase their abilities, giving them little room for even the slightest bit of depth. \"Lactose Lunacy\" attempts to mix horror, comedy, and gross-out gore into a twisted treat, but it ultimately serves up a repugnant smorgasbord that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. If you value your enjoyment of ice cream and a good night's sleep, I recommend steering far away from this unpalatable disaster. Overall, this is a sad excuse for a movie; one that leaves the viewer feeling removed rather than entertained.", "Kurt Zouma Steals the Spotlight in Chelsea's Win Against Manchester United Sunday's Premier League match-up featured Chelsea and Manchester United battling it out, with Chelsea securing a win with a 1-0 victory. A key factor in Chelsea's triumph was the outstanding performance of French defender, Kurt Zouma. The 20-year-old played as a defensive midfielder, focusing his efforts on keeping Marouane Fellaini out of the game. Chelsea boss, Jose Mourinho, was particularly impressed with Zouma's form during his first season with the club, and had confidence in his ability to control Fellaini's performance. Zouma's excellent show of skill and determination in the match has proven Mourinho's critics wrong. As he continues to perform at a high level, Zouma is solidifying his position as an essential player for Chelsea's ongoing success in the Premier League. Chelsea supporters can only hope to see more of Zouma's agility and finesse in upcoming games. With the coach's support and Mourinho's proven expertise in getting the job done, there is no doubt that Zouma will continue to make a significant impact on the team's gameplay this season.", "In Caco-2TC7 cells, insulin action diminished the transepithelial transfer of sugar and reduced BBM and basolateral membrane (BLM) GLUT2 levels, demonstrating that insulin can target sugar absorption by controlling the membrane localization of GLUT2 in enterocytes. Similarly, in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments in sensitive mice, insulin abolished GLUT2 (i.e., the cytochalasin B-sensitive component of fructose absorption), decreased BBM GLUT2, and concomitantly increased intracellular GLUT2. Acute insulin treatment before sugar intake prevented the insertion of GLUT2 into the BBM. Insulin resistance in mice provoked a loss of GLUT2 trafficking, and GLUT2 levels remained permanently high in the BBM and low in the BLM. We propose that, in addition to its peripheral effects, insulin inhibits intestinal sugar absorption to prevent excessive blood glucose excursion after a sugar meal. This protective mechanism is lost in the insulin-resistant state induced by high-fat or high-fructose feeding.", "With great expectations I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar-race this year. Part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. It fails in delivering the \"message\" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense). The Spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and rapidly losing patience, and some of the commentaries I overheard was whether the members of the Spanish Academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the Oscar contest.", "Yes, a 22-mer primer can enhance the discriminatory power of AP-PCR fingerprinting technique in the characterization of leptospires. AP-PCR (Arbitrarily Primed PCR) fingerprinting is a molecular typing method that helps differentiate between different strains of a microorganism, in this case, Leptospira. The discriminatory power of AP-PCR fingerprinting is influenced by the choice of the primer, which is an essential component of the PCR process. A 22-mer primer refers to a primer that consists of 22 nucleotide bases. Longer primers, like a 22-mer, can increase the specificity of the PCR reaction, leading to the amplification of more specific DNA fragments and improving the ability to differentiate between different strains of Leptospira. Using a 22-mer primer can essentially produce more diverse and distinct DNA fingerprints that are more easily compared, leading to a higher resolution in the characterization of the leptospires. However, the optimization of PCR conditions and primer selection should be carefully considered for the best results in the fingerprinting technique.", "Snakes on a Plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week. Reading the other comments here I see the results. A lot of people are mad. Mad because it doesn't have the best special effects. Mad because it doesn't have a star cast. Mad because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say \"I'm sick of these M-Er F Ing Snakes on this M-Er F Ing Train\"! Well, this sure ain't the Samuel Jackson version. And maybe that's good.Snakes on a Plane was lost between cop film and horror, a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death. Saturday Night Live performers got laughs while Jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears, and as far as kids go, they would be traumatized by the violence.Snakes on a Train however knew exactly what it was. This was a cheaply made horror movie on a train. Sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects. But never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the \"on a Plane\" version was tripping all over itself from the first scene on.I did enjoy the over the top fun that Snakes on a Plane had to offer and I admit that the ...\"on a Train\" version was a little dry. But hey, in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did.For this it gets a 7 out of 10.", "I am not afraid of bad movies. In fact, sometimes I find them oddly entertaining. But what I encountered in \"Attack of the 50ft Plot Holes\" was beyond my wildest nightmares. It was not just a bad movie; it was an abomination that left me questioning the very existence of good taste and cinematic artistry. From the very first frame, the terrible CGI work assaulted my senses, making me instantly aware that I was in for a rough ride. The characters were painfully one-dimensional, their dialogue stiff and forced, like a high school theater production with minimal rehearsal time. The plot revolved around the sudden emergence of gigantic plot holes that swallowed cities and people wholea concept that seemed almost too self-aware, as if the director somehow knew just how many plot inconsistencies his own movie was devouring. Acting-wise, the performances went from wooden to over-the-top, with not a single actor managing to find the sweet spot in between. It felt as if everyone was aware of the disaster unfolding before them but had no idea how to save it, floundering desperately as the movie spiraled into chaos. And then there was the editing. Scenes seemed to be stitched together at random, with transitions so abrupt that I found myself wondering if my seat had become a time machine that thrust me forward every few minutes. The sound mix was a disaster, with explosive effects drowning out crucial dialogue and music cues that appeared entirely unrelated to the on-screen action. At the end of it all, I emerged from the theater dazed and bewildered, feeling as if I had just gone through some sort of horrendous cinematic torture. \"Attack of the 50ft Plot Holes\" is not just a bad movie; it's a disaster of epic proportions that should never have been unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences. If you value your sanity and your love for the art of filmmaking, I urge you to stay far, far away from this monstrosity.", "Police in Surrey are hunting two raiders who stripped off their tops during the hottest day of the year before holding up an Esso petrol station. The men, who were both in their 20s, . These bare-chested men had stripped off before raiding a petrol station on the hottest day of the years so far and were caught on camera. Police in Surrey have released CCTV of the two raiders who stripped-off their shirts before attempting to rob the Esso filling station in Town End Caterham, Surrey early last Wednesday evening . The men forced their way into the manager's office of the filling station in Caterham, pictured, looking for cash . Police released these images of the men which they hope will lead to calls from the public, identifying them. The two men were among three who burst into the Esso petrol station in Town End, Caterham, Surrey, last Wednesday. They forced their way into the manager's office and were ransacking the room, looking for cash, when they were disturbed by a member of the garage staff and fled. A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Officers were called to the Esso petrol station after three men entered the store, forced entry into the manager's office and whilst ransacking the room were disturbed by staff. They left with a mobile phone belonging to a member of staff. 'No-one was injured during the incident which occurred at around 7.45pm.' Police constable Natalie Pearce said: 'Since the incident we have made a number of inquiries into the burglary including viewing CCTV. We believe the men captured on camera will be able to assist us with our investigation. 'If you are one of the men in the images we are releasing or if you recognise the men, please contact Surrey Police.'

P63 is a member of the p53 family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, such as cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. In the case of prostate adenocarcinoma, p63 protein is frequently absent or expressed at very low levels, which is in contrast to other prostate pathologies, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), where p63 expression is often found at higher levels. One of the reasons for the rarity of p63 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma is that the cells which give rise to this cancer type are typically p63-negative. In addition, mutations and deletions in p63 can contribute to the development and progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. The relative absence of p63 protein expression in prostate adenocarcinoma can be useful for diagnostic purposes. Immunohistochemical analysis of p63 protein expression can help pathologists differentiate prostate adenocarcinoma from benign prostatic hyperplasia or other prostate lesions, as the latter usually show positive p63 staining. However, there are some limitations to this approach, as some cases of prostate adenocarcinoma may show focal p63 expression. Therefore, it is crucial to consider other diagnostic markers, clinical history, and imaging studies for a definitive cancer diagnosis. As for carcinogenesis, the low expression of p63 in prostate adenocarcinoma cells suggests that it might play a role in the development andor progression of this cancer type. P63 has been shown to have both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic functions, depending on the particular isoform and cellular context. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of p63 in prostate adenocarcinoma may provide insights into the biology of this cancer type and potentially reveal new therapeutic targets. In conclusion, the rarity of p63 protein expression in prostate adenocarcinoma holds diagnostic significance and may provide valuable insights into the study of carcinogenesis. Further research on p63's role in prostate cancer development and progression could aid in the development of better diagnostic tools and treatment options for patients.", "Distal femoral condyle is internally rotated to the patellar tendon at 90 of flexion in normal knees. When the symmetric femoral component is aligned perpendicular to the femoral mechanical axis, the patellar tendon would be possibly more twisted than the condition in normal knees, and the deviation of the PF contact force on the patellar component might be caused. The configuration and alignment of the distal condyle of the femoral component can affect the PF joint congruity in knee flexion. In this respect, our results provide important information in considering designs and alignment in the distal femur of TKA and the PF joint congruity in knee flexion.", "Well, I saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other making-of from VH1. Too bad that this one is pretty outdated, but you get to see all the staff who make South Park - very interesting stuff. It's also funny that this documentary portrays Trey and Matt like selfish, greedy snobs who don't work and spend all their time having fun or relaxing (which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the show). It also shows all the animation processes to make a South Park episode, interviews with the actors who bring characters' voices to life, and much more. If you're a fan of South Park, I highly recommend you check this out. It may be a bit dated, but it's definitely an entertaining and informative look behind the scenes of this iconic show.", "The COMT ValMet polymorphism may modulate the effects of tDCS on response inhibition, but more research is needed to provide a definitive answer. This is due to the fact that the relationship between the COMT ValMet polymorphism, tDCS, and response inhibition is complex and involves multiple brain networks. The COMT ValMet polymorphism is a genetic variant that affects the activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme involved in the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. The Val (valine) allele is associated with higher COMT activity, which leads to lower dopamine levels, while the Met (methionine) allele is associated with lower COMT activity and higher dopamine levels. Dopamine plays a crucial role in the regulation of cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory, and response inhibition. tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that modulates neuronal excitability, with potential effects on cognitive functions. While there is evidence that tDCS can improve cognitive performance in some individuals, its effects on response inhibition remain inconclusive. There are some studies suggesting that the COMT ValMet polymorphism can modulate the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance, but these studies are mostly focused on working memory or other cognitive domains. It is plausible that the COMT ValMet polymorphism might also influence the effects of tDCS on response inhibition, considering the importance of dopamine in this cognitive function. However, further research is needed to specifically investigate the interaction between the COMT ValMet polymorphism, tDCS, and response inhibition. This research should ideally include large sample sizes, controlled study designs, and standardized measures of response inhibition to establish more reliable and conclusive evidence.", "This is one of the best Czech movies I have ever seen.

However, in insulin-resistant mice, this regulatory function is impaired. Less GLUT2 is translocated to the cell membrane in response to insulin, leading to reduced glucose uptake and contributing to the overall problem of insulin resistance. To clarify, enterocytes are the cells that line the small intestine and play a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients, including glucose. GLUT2 is a glucose transporter protein that facilitates the transport of glucose across the cell membrane. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels. In healthy conditions, insulin causes an increase in GLUT2 on the cell membrane of enterocytes, leading to more efficient glucose uptake. Insulin resistance disrupts this process, contributing to impaired glucose homeostasis.", "Person1: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried taking any pain relievers for your headache? Person2: Yeah, I took some earlier but it's not working yet. And I've tried going to bed early, but I just can't fall asleep. Person1: That sounds rough. Have you considered talking to a doctor about your sleep trouble or seeking help at a sleep clinic? Person2: I haven't thought about that, to be honest. Maybe I should give it a try if things don't improve. Person1: It might be worth it. In the meantime, perhaps you could try some relaxing activities before bed like reading, meditation, or taking a warm bath to help you fall asleep. Person2: Thanks for the suggestions, I'll definitely try those. I just hope I can get better sleep soon. Person1: I hope so too.

The diagnosis pulled Green away from the game for the entire 2011-2012 basketball season, but transformed his life in the process. Today, nearly a decade after his surgery, Green continues to pour his heart out in a different way - donating his time to young cardiovascular patients. Green's journey began in late 2011 when a routine physical examination led to the discovery of an aortic aneurysm. An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous condition, in which the heart's aorta weakens and bulges, increasing the risk of rupture. For the then 25-year-old athlete, this news came as a shock, but it forced him to prioritize his health over his passion for basketball. After a successful surgery, Green was adamant about making the most of his experience and using it to inspire others. \"I'm very blessed to be here. Every day that I step on the floor, it's a reminder of what I went through and what the process was to get back,\" he said. Today, Green is a strong advocate for heart health and dedicates his time to helping young cardiovascular patients at various hospitals and organizations. As a mentor, he shares his story with affected children, inspiring them to remain resilient and tenacious to face their challenges. Additionally, the NBA star actively raises awareness for cardiovascular research and campaigns, which aid in finding new treatments and therapies. Green's remarkable recovery not only allowed him to resume his roaring basketball career but also serves as a beacon of hope for those battling similar health issues. His continued commitment to help raise awareness and funds for heart health research, while also providing emotional support to those going through similar trials, highlights Green's dedication and ability to turn this life-changing event into a powerful and impactful movement. In 2021, Green will mark the 10-year anniversary of his surgery. Since returning to the court, he has become a crucial player for various NBA teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Houston Rockets. Currently playing for the Brooklyn Nets, Green's journey has undoubtedly created a lasting impact on the lives of countless young cardiovascular patients and will continue to inspire others for years to come.", "One of the biggest fixtures on the German footballing calendar takes place this weekend, although some of the usual gloss has been taken off a game recently baptised Der Klassiker. Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them and Bayern are set to continue their domestic domination this term. This time, however, the two giant antagonists of the German game meet with 31 points and nine positions separating them in the standings, but that does not mean the stakes are not as high as they always are when these two clubs meet. Jurgen Klopp (centre) celebrates with hisBorussia Dortmund players after their victory against Hannover . Dortmund are now only five points from the top six having climbed their way from the foot of the table at the midway stage of the season to 10th, although their coach Jurgen Klopp insists their league position after the Klassiker is not his biggest concern. 'We've got to try to beat Bayern and where that can take us in the league is secondary,' Klopp said. 'Although we're 10th, and although there's a huge points gap between us, and although a lot is different compared to the past, it's still a Borussia Dortmund home game. 'I don't recall us gifting any of these games in the past. Dortmund'sJakub Blaszczykowski (right) challenges Hannover centre backChristian Schulz . 'Gladbach have shown us how it's done. Wolfsburg have also beaten them, but it's not all that easy.' Victory would nevertheless be important for Dortmund if they are to close the gap on the top six and qualify for Europe next season, while a second consecutive defeat for Bayern is almost unheard of and it would allow Wolfsburg to reduce the deficit at the top to seven points. The Wolves host bottom-placed Stuttgart on Saturday while third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach can strengthen their grip on a place in the Champions League with a win at Hoffenheim. The battle at the bottom of the table is intensifying with all of the bottom eight sides separated by just seven points and still in danger. Xabi Alonso cuts a cool figure during Bayern Munich's training session on Thursday . Hamburg reacted to their slide into the bottom three by appointing Peter Knabel as their new coach during the international break and his first game is a daunting trip to fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The northern Germany side therefore risk coming out the other side of the weekend inside the bottom two with Paderborn travelling to Hertha Berlin on Sunday. Freiburg and Cologne are also involved in that scrap and they meet on Saturday with Mainz travelling to Werder Bremen. Elsewhere, Augsburg host Schalke on Sunday and Eintracht Frankfurt welcome Hannover and their under-fire coach Tayfun Korkut to the Waldstadion.", "Person1: IBA, Client Services Department.

Their chemistry is undeniable and adds depth to the heartfelt love story being brought to life on the screen. \"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\" offers compelling insight into the complexities of cross-cultural relationships during a time where society was less accepting of their existence. The film holds a mirror to the prejudices and limitations of society, while proving that love, in its various forms, can transform hearts and minds. The beautiful and nostalgic score by Alfred Newman complements the film's theme of love transcending boundaries, and adds a sense of melancholy that increases the emotional impact of the story. In conclusion, \"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\" is a classic romantic drama worth watching for its compelling love story, powerful performances, stunning visuals, and evocative score. It is a moving portrayal of love defying societal expectations, proving that love, in all its forms, is indeed a many-splendored thing.", "Wow, where to begin with this one. Well, if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers, then this one is for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I never pass up an opportunity to laugh at B-movie God Casper Van Dien's blunders, and boy was this one of them. It may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on Halloween. He dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. At some points this is a man in costume, at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. This monster has the uncanny ability to see with \"predator\" vision, a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes it doesn't. This thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of \"Critters.\" This creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his killing spree, which we never really find out why he is on, he gets blown up. This is an incredible feat, for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. But, I guess this last time was the charm. And don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. First of all, what Delta Force unit employs women? Last I checked the military still disallows women into combat situations. Also, this unit is \"undercover.\" Why? What possible reason would they have to be undercover? And they're not even good at it, I guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms, BUT THEY WERE ALL CARRYING MACHINE GUNS (which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film, at some points sounding like air rifle BB guns, and at others, canons). There is one part when the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers from a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto. At another point. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. They tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline, but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. Then when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman at the \"top\" of the \"hill\" the rope goes upward from her grip, not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill. Rooker actually has a line that says, \"I'm not going after him, I going after it.\" What? That is quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever heard, and I watch these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writingproduction of this film thought that it was so bad-ass. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialog, this is good. The acting, bad. The makeup, really bad. These characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. Maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face. Yeah, I think I'll make a movie about that, \"Attack of the Alien Scars that Move Around on Your Face.\" That villain would be more intimidating than the Skeleton Man, and the film would probably be scarier.", "Yes, iKKCHUK (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha) may regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling independently of its kinase activity to facilitate articular chondrocyte differentiation. A study published in the journal Nature Communications in 2018 revealed that iKKCHUK non-canonically binds to YAPTAZ (Yes-associated protein and PDZ-binding motif) in the cytoplasm, consequently promoting the nuclear translocation of YAPTAZ for transcriptional regulation of ECM remodeling genes. This process facilitates the maturation and differentiation of articular chondrocytes and highlights the potential relevance of iKKCHUK in cartilage biology and the regulation of ECM remodeling independent of its kinase activity. However, more studies need to be conducted to discern the full extent of iKKCHUK on ECM remodeling and articular chondrocyte differentiation with a focus on its kinase-independent functions.", "101-Year-Old Woman Stays Fit with Strength Exercises and Step Classes, Defying Age Stereotypes Sydney, Australia - At the sprightly age of 101, Salvina Formosa is defying stereotypes and breaking barriers by staying fit and active. Every week, she engages in weight exercises and sit-to-stand routines, in addition to participating in step classes to improve her overall fitness levels. The centenarian, who celebrated her 101st birthday on March 16, shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, her dedication to maintaining her physical health was evident when she recently tripped over an uneven footpath and decided to work on her balance and strength by joining step classes. Her fitness journey has not only improved her endurance, but it has also provided her with a sense of empowerment and independence. As the Sydney mother continues to pursue her fitness goals, she serves as an inspiration to many, demonstrating that age is just a number and that it is never too late to start working on one's health and well-being. Family, friends, and fellow gym-goers have all been amazed by Formosa's energy and dedication, as she never misses a workout session and always brings a positive attitude. Her passion for staying active and fit has been passed down to her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, proving that her impact extends beyond just herself. Fitness trainers and doctors alike have praised Formosa for her commitment and perseverance, which has undoubtedly contributed to her longevity and quality of life. By embracing a healthy lifestyle and staying motivated, she has been able to retain her strength and vitality despite her age.

Khan is expected to announce his next opponent imminently, with British rival Kell Brook set to feature on his agenda for a Wembley blockbuster next year. Amir Khan appears on the screen as Adrien Broner urges him to make their fight happen on FaceTime . Broner says, 'Let's get this money', in the short video of their conversation posted on Instagram . Khan hasn't fought since his win over Devon Alexander in December and has struggled to find an opponent . Broner has been relentless in his calling out of Khan since his comfortable win over John Molina Jr . But in the shorter term, the Bolton fighter has held talks with American Broner, who tweeted a video of himself and Khan talking via video. He included the hashtag BronervsKhan. In the video, Broner tells Khan: 'Hey, tell them to make the fight, man, let's get this money.' It's by no means certain that the fight will go ahead, with Broner seemingly more keen than Khan. However, the Brit has previously encouraged talk of a bout against a man whose brash manner has made him a big draw in his homeland. Khan is targeting a fight at the end of May before breaking for Ramadan in mid-June, with a distant hope of facing the winner of Floyd Mayweather's May 2 showdown with Manny Pacquiao. Brook remains the money-spinning fight on the agenda, with Khan having said on Tuesday that he wants to fight the IBF welterweight world champion at Wembley within 12 months. Broner posts a cheeky artist's impression of what he believes would happen should he fight Khan . Khan has said he would love to fight Broner in lieu of not being able to get in the ring with Floyd Mayweather . Khan says he has given his word to his next opponent and will be making an announcement 'very soon' Brook was due to fight in July but revealed he has brought forward his plans following his demolition of Jo Jo Dan last Saturday. He said: 'I have told Eddie Hearn to get me out as soon as possible and I want to fight twice before the end of the summer, starting at the end of May.'", "Person1: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. Person2: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. Person1: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? Person2: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. Person1: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. Person2: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUISDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. Person1: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? Person2: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. Person1: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 (K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. Person2: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. Person1: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!", "Person1: Thank you. What information do I need in order to fill out the application?

Additionally, you'll need a proof of residency, such as a utility bill, to confirm your address. Person1: Alright, I have all that with me. How long will it take to get my library card after I submit the application? Person2: Once you've completed the application and provided the necessary documents, it should only take a few minutes to process and create your library card. You'll be able to use it right away. Person1: Great! Are there any limits on how many books or items can be checked out at a time? Person2: With your new library card, you can check out up to 10 items at a time, including books, audiobooks, and DVDs. Remember that items have different loan periods, so be sure to check the due dates when you borrow them. Person1: That sounds good. What are the late fees if I don't return items on time? Person2: Late fees vary depending on the item. For books and audiobooks, it's 25 cents per day, and for DVDs, it's 1 per day. To avoid late fees, you can renew most items up to two times, either online or by phone. Person1: That's helpful to know. Can I reserve items online if they're currently checked out? Person2: Yes, you can place a hold on items that are checked out through our online catalog using your library card number and PIN. You'll receive a notification when the item becomes available.

Following a close win over Jessie Vargas, \"The Problem\" posted a video of his FaceTime conversation with the British professional boxer. In the video, the American made it clear that he was hungry for a fight with Khan, saying, \"You know I want to fight you.\" Khan, a former unified light-welterweight world champion, responded with a smile. Khan recently took to Twitter to announce that he had already given his word to his next opponent. While he did not mention a name, rumors suggest that Kell Brook could be another possible choice. However, Khan prefers to wait for the right opportunity to face Brook, implying that a match-up with Broner could be closer than expected. The potential fight between Broner and Khan has turned heads in the boxing community, with fans eager to see two of the sport's most exciting personalities go head-to-head. Both fighters have had their fair share of controversy, but their skills in the ring have been captivating audiences for years. Broner, known for his flashy and brash antics, holds a record of 34 wins, 3 losses, and 1 draw. Despite his win over Vargas, the American has had a rough patch in recent years, with inconsistent performances and personal issues affecting his career. On the other hand, Khan has had a successful return to the ring following his notable knockout loss in 2016. With a comeback victory over Phil Lo Greco in just 39 seconds, Khan proved that he has the potential to rise to the top once more. Both Broner and Khan are at a point in their careers where a high-profile bout could be a much-needed turning point. At the moment, however, no details or arrangement between the two camps have been confirmed. With both fighters seemingly open to a clash, it remains to be seen whether a bout between \"The Problem\" and \"King\" Khan will come to fruition. Nevertheless, the possibility of these two dynamic athletes facing off is an undeniably tantalizing prospect for boxing fans around the world.", "Attack: Lee Keeley, 38, grabbed the unnamed woman and hit her head against a wall before stamping on her head and chest in a courtroom . An ex-boyfriend flew into a furious rage and attacked his former partner in the middle of a courtroom. Lee Keeley grabbed the unnamed woman and hit her head against a wall before stamping on her head and chest at Lincoln County Court, after a judge ruled against him in a civil matter. The 38-year-old defendant chased her round the courtroom and tore out clumps of her hair after losing his temper in January. A court heard Keeley launched a chair at his ex-girlfriend before he started attacking her and barristers had to step in to break the pair up. The victim suffered a cut to her right ear, bruising and swelling to the ear, a grazed cheek as well as bruised ribs. Last Thursday, Keeley appeared before another judge at Lincoln Crown Court and admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was jailed for two years and given an indefinite restraining order, preventing him from contacting his former partner. Sentencing, Judge Michael Heath said: 'I understand your disappointment but your behaviour after the decision was outrageous.' A court heard Keeley, from Lincoln, had become increasingly agitated during the hearing and then erupted as Judge Richard Toombs announced the decision. Shocking scene: Keeley chased the woman round the courtroom at Lincoln County Court (above) and tore out clumps of her hair after losing his temper when the judge ruled against him in a civil matter in January . Keeley, who had represented himself, began arguing with the judge then turned on his ex-partner. David Outterside, prosecuting, said Keeley shouted an insult at the woman before adding: 'He then picked up a chair and threw it at the victim but missed her. 'He then chased after her. Twice they ran round and round the court as he tried to get hold of her.' The court heard Keeley later told police he went into a rage when the decision was announced. He said he recalled throwing the chair but could not remember anything after that. David Eager, defending, said Keeley had 'simply lost control'.", "Person1: Well, what a nice day!

Based on a comparison of these structures, the induced fit that is necessary for catalysis and closing of the active-site cleft appears to be confined to the small lobe, as in the absence of the peptide the conformation of the large lobe, including the peptide-docking surface, does not change. Three specific components contribute to the closing of the cleft: rotation of the small lobe; movement of the C-terminal tail; and closing of the so-called glycine-rich loop. There is no induced fit in the large lobe to accommodate the peptide and the closing of the cleft. A portion of the C-terminal tail, residues 315-334, serves as a gate for the entry or exit of the nucleotide into the hydrophobic active-site cleft.", "I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you. The cast in this movie was top notch. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story was very good, even though her part was rather small. She also played in a terrific made for television thriller around the same time called You'll Never See Me Again with David Hartman.I got the biggest kick out of Eileen Heckart's performance as the housekeeper. Eileen was so good as a lady with a very bad disposition.George Maharis who played the husband was quite effective.This story obviously had a lot of so called mistakes in the plot, but I love the movie anyway.

A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to theDallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a 50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'", "b Sol Campbell puts his Chelsea flat on the market for 6.75millionb Former England footballer Sol Campbell has placed his luxurious Chelsea flat on the market for 6.75million. The 40-year-old top-class defender bought the property in 2011 and it has since been refurbished by his wife Fiona, 43. Campbell, an outspoken critic of Labour's mansion tax proposal, sold his 20million London townhouse earlier this year. As one of the most beloved players in English football history, Campbell earned a huge fortune throughout his impressive career. However, since retiring from the soccer pitch, Campbell does not seem to be enjoying the London property tax measures and had publicly criticised Labour's proposed mansion tax. Campbell's substantial property portfolio includes a 25million five-story Georgian townhouse in Chelsea and a 10million six-bedroom estate in Crowborough, East Sussex. In total, Campbell reportedly owns properties worth around 50million. The Chelsea flat is a gated and luxurious duplex of demanding architectural design, which went through expensive renovation under Fiona's vision. The property has a double guest bedroom and a master bedroom on the first floor and a stunning open-plan living room, dining room, kitchen, and study on the second floor. The apartment boasts over 3,000 sq ft across the two floors. Given the prime location and the lavish renovation works, prospective buyers can expect to pay the premium price.

The report also found that men spent twice as much as women on computers, digital accessories, mobile apps, and streaming services. Additionally, families with children at home were found to spend 50 per cent more to stay digitally connected than singles, couples without children and empty nesters. One third of households were found to not budget for technology or wildly underestimate how much they will spend on technology. In light of these findings, Suncorp Bank is urging Australians to reconsider their tech spending habits and incorporate technology expenses into their budgets, ensuring they get the best value for their needs. This news comes as no surprise as Australia continues on its path towards becoming a more digitally-connected society. The rapid growth of the tech industry in the country has led to an increased demand for gadgets, accessories, and other accompanying services such as streaming platforms. This increased demand has consequently driven up the amount spent on technology by Australians in the past year. The findings of the report suggest that men were found to be more inclined to spend on technology as compared to women, with the former group spending twice as much on items such as computers, digital accessories, mobile apps, and streaming services. This disparity in tech spending behaviour between the genders may be attributed to a variety of factors, including the perceived value and utility of certain tech items and services. Additionally, the report found that families with children at home were found to spend 50 percent more to stay digitally connected than singles, couples without children and empty nesters. This could be due to the need for providing children with appropriate technological tools for their education and entertainment purposes, as well as increased parents' digital consumption for various household tasks such as working remotely and managing finances. The report also revealed that one third of Australian households either do not budget for technology or grossly underestimate their tech spending. In response to this, Suncorp Bank has encouraged these households to reconsider their tech spending habits and incorporate technology expenses into their budgets. By doing so, it is expected that households will be in a better position to make the most of their financial resources and ensure they are receiving the best value for their tech needs. The report serves as a reminder to Australians of the need to remain mindful of their spending habits on technology, particularly as the country becomes increasingly digitised. With 20 billion spent on technology in the past year, it is clear that tech is now an integral part of Australians' lives, highlighting the need for proper budgeting and financial planning to ensure a well-balanced and financially healthy lifestyle.", "Yes, temporal properties of network-mediated responses to repetitive stimuli are dependent upon retinal ganglion cell type. Different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain. They have distinct morphological and physiological properties that enable them to perform specific functions in visual processing. RGCs have unique temporal properties that enable them to respond differently to repetitive stimuli. Some types of RGCs have fast-adapting responses, meaning they quickly adapt to repetitive stimuli and their responses become weaker as the stimulus continues. Conversely, other RGC types are slow-adapting and maintain a more consistent response throughout the duration of the stimulus. These differences in the temporal properties of RGCs contribute to complex visual processing mechanisms, allowing the retina to encode a wide range of visual information and respond to various types of temporal stimulus changes effectively. Thus, the temporal properties of network-mediated responses to repetitive stimuli are shaped by the specific types of retinal ganglion cells involved.", "An insane assault on viewers senses.

P23 is a protein that plays an essential role in the proper functioning of the nervous system, and its dysregulation can lead to motor coordination deficits. By creating transgenic mice with varying levels of p23 expression specifically in neurons, researchers can investigate how this protein affects motor function. These studies have revealed that maintaining the appropriate levels of p23 expression in neurons is critical for proper motor coordination. Too much or too little p23 can lead to movement abnormalities and other neurological issues.", "In contrast to normal and preneoplastic prostatic tissue, the vast majority of prostate adenocarcinomas do not express p63. Therefore, p63 immunohistochemistry represents a potential novel adjuvant method for facilitating the pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer in prostate needle biopsies. The selective expression of p63 in normal basal cells, coupled with the finding that p63 null mice fail to develop prostates, provides strong evidence that the basal cells represent prostatic epithelial stem cells. In addition, these findings suggest that p63 may protect prostatic epithelial cells against neoplastic transformation and support the hypothesis that intermediately differentiated cells in the luminal epithelium of PIA are the targets of neoplastic transformation in the prostate.", "Person1: I understand your frustration.

A study published in the Journal of Cellular Physiology (Park et al., 2015) investigated the role of Gas6 in thrombin-induced expression of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. The study found that Gas6 negatively regulates thrombin-induced VCAM-1 expression through FoxO1-dependent mechanisms in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that Gas6 could potentially play a role in preventing thrombin-induced inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Reference: Park, H., Adsit, F. G., Cress, D. E. (2015).

They mentioned that there have been some secret discussions between the two companies lately, and that an official announcement might be coming soon. They even interviewed some insiders who confirmed the merger talks. Person2: Wow, I must admit that would be a significant change in our industry. But the article could just be speculating, and we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. Let's wait for the official announcement before we start worrying about how it will affect our market strategy. Person1: You're right, we shouldn't be hasty in our reactions. However, I think it's a good idea to start brainstorming how this could potentially impact our business and what steps we could take to stay ahead of the game. Person2: Good thinking. Let's discuss this further in our upcoming team meeting and make sure everyone is aware of these discussions and the potential impact it could have on our company. We should also consider seeking input from other departments, like marketing and finance, to help us determine the best course of action. Person1: Absolutely. I'll email everyone to give them a heads-up about this news and ask them to come prepared with some thoughts for the meeting.

In our setting, the situation of living with nonspouse family, friends, or other persons in a nonsupervised setting and a history of family disruption by widowhood, divorce, or separation were significant correlates of abuse. Suggestive but nonsignificant trends of potential importance (OR or 2.0) included female sex, alcohol abuse, and lowest quartile of functional status.

Standardization ensures uniform experimental conditions, techniques, and data analysis methods, reducing the potential for variation among datasets. This consistency allows for more accurate comparisons between datasets, as it reduces discrepancies that might arise from differences in experimental design or data processing. As a result, researchers can draw more reliable conclusions and identify true biological differences between the samples being compared, rather than being misled by variations introduced due to technical differences in data collection or analysis.", "Most PVD patients with normal serum creatinine have occult, significantly impaired renal function as defined by creatinine clearance. Vascular surgeons should include creatinine clearance in pre-operative assessment of renal function especially in patients over 75 years old, with a history of coronary heart disease or a serum creatinine over 85 micromoll. The method of determining creatinine clearance could be the Cockcroft-Gault calculation or ideally 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurement. This would allow appropriate early referral to a nephrologist for further investigation and management. It is worth noting that statin use seems to be associated with a protective effect on renal function.", "MSLL technology provides an unparalleled approach for mapping the epigenetic status of repetitive blocks and for identifying sequences mis-identified as genes. Although the types and natures of epigenetic boundaries are barely understood at this time, MSLL technology flags both approximate boundaries and methylated genes that deserve additional investigation. MSLL and HMPR sequences provide a valuable resource for maize genome annotation, and are a uniquely valuable complement to any plant genome sequencing project. In order to make these results fully accessible to the community, a web display was developed that shows the alignment of MSLL, HMPR, and other gene-rich sequences to the BACs; this display is continually updated with the latest ESTs and BAC sequences.", "Chemotherapy was active, with pT0N0 and pT1N0 downstaging rates of 38 and 53, respectively, and 5-yr overall survival (OS) of 63.

The movie, \"Rising Stars\" explores the world of aspiring musicians and the challenges they face on their road to success. With a well-crafted storyline and an ensemble of unforgettable characters, this independent film took me on an emotional roller coaster, from laughter to tears, and held my attention from start to finish. The ensemble cast delivered phenomenal performances, bringing life and depth to their characters. The standout performance was given by Sarah, a small-town singer with big dreams, portrayed by a newcomer Lily James. Her raw talent, emotional vulnerability, and resilience were felt throughout the entire film. The chemistry among the cast members felt genuine and contributed to the authenticity of the film. The cinematography was beautifully composed, showcasing the various atmospheres in which the characters lived and performed. From the dimly lit dive bars to the sun-soaked beaches, each scene was immersive and inviting. The soundtrack featured an array of songs, both originals and covers, that perfectly encapsulated the mood and theme of the film. Let me tell you, the songs are so catchy that I can't get them out of my head even now! One aspect of the film I particularly appreciated was the way it highlighted the struggles and sacrifices artists have to make in pursuit of their dreams. \"Rising Stars\" didn't shy away from the harsh reality that fame comes at a price but also showcased the importance of perseverance, friendship, and family throughout the journey. Overall, \"Rising Stars\" hit all the right notes for me - it was heartwarming, thought-provoking, and entertaining. Definitely, a must-see film for fans of music and indie dramas. Don't wait too long to check this one out; it's a true hidden gem!", "Arizona Inmate Punches Guards, Prompts Hospitalization, and Defies Taser Shots Phoenix, Arizona - Two guards were knocked out cold when an unidentified 18-year-old inmate at a Phoenix correctional facility attacked them, in response to their order to return to his cell. The young man was eventually subdued, but not before four taser shots failed to have any effect on him. Officer Scott Beaty, 44, is now in intensive care with broken facial bones and a brain hemorrhage, while another officer is recovering from his injuries. According to investigators, no weapons were involved and both officers were wearing their standard issue protective vests at the time of the incident. Details of the event are still unclear, but it is believed that the inmate was not in restraints when the altercation occurred, and he reportedly had shown no signs of hostility prior to lashing out. The incident took place in a segregation unit, where inmates are held under tighter security due to either the nature of their crimes or behavior issues. Despite being in a high-security area and the presence of the two officers, the young man managed to land blows powerful enough to hospitalize both guards. While such incidents are not unheard of, the fact that the inmate was able to withstand four taser shots before being subdued is a cause for concern within the law enforcement community. Aside from the physical injuries sustained to the officers and the psychological impact on them and their colleagues, such an occurrence raises important questions about the safety and effectiveness of current safety measures in prisons. The issue of potential body armor enhancements has been a controversial topic in light of numerous violent incidents involving inmates and officers in the past. The inmate in question now faces charges of assault with serious physical injury and aggravated assault on a correctional officer, and a criminal investigation is underway as to the cause and circumstances of the altercation. Responding quickly to the situation, the Arizona Department of Corrections has ordered a review of the security policies and procedures in place at the Phoenix facility to determine if improvements are necessary. As the investigation unfolds, prison officials and law enforcement personnel will work together to understand how this young man managed to punch his way through multiple layers of security and to prevent similar incidents in the future. In the meantime, the Arizona corrections community sends its thoughts and prayers to the injured officers as they begin their road to recovery.", "Yes, the primary metabolism of chickpea can be an initial target during the early sensing of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri race I, which is a fungus that causes wilt disease in chickpea plants. When wounds are induced in the plant, the fungus can penetrate the roots and rapidly colonize the plant, affecting its primary metabolism processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake. However, the host plant also mounts defense responses, such as producing phytoalexins, reactive oxygen species, and pathogenesis-related proteins. The interaction between the host defense mechanism and the pathogen ultimately determines the outcome of the infection.", "We validated our method by comparing the experiment-to-experiment variation between biological replicates of chromatin preparations from S. cerevisiae. Results from our matched preparation consistently produced MNase-seq datasets that were more closely correlated than other unstandardized approaches. Additionally, we validated the ability of our approach at enabling accurate downstream comparisons of chromatin structures, by comparing the specificity of detecting Tup1-dependent chromatin remodeling events in comparisons between matched and un-matched wild-type and tup1 MNase-seq datasets. Our matched MNase-seq datasets demonstrated a significant reduction in non-specific (technical) differences between experiments and were able to maximize the detection of biologically-relevant (Tup1-dependent) changes in chromatin structure.", "If anyone at National Lampoon is reading this, PLEASE STOP THE CRAP YOU'RE PULLING OUT OF YOUR BUM, really now! The recent release, \"Disaster Lampoon-athon,\" is undeniably the epitome of lazy scriptwriting, subpar acting, and an almost offensive lack of humor. The convoluted plot, which involves a ragtag group of misfits seeking treasure buried underneath a fraternity house, is not only unoriginal but also incoherently strung together by poorly executed slapstick gags and cheap, juvenile humor that leaves the audience squirming in their seats out of discomfort. Worst of all, the acting feels like a hastily thrown together student project, with characters as shallow as cardboard cutouts and delivery as wooden as the literal planks they are searching for. The cast sadly lacks any chemistry, making the weak jokes and sitcom-style misunderstandings fall even flatter. As a long-time fan of National Lampoon, this movie feels like a betrayal of the brand's legacy. The team behind this disaster should take a step back, take a deep breath, and refocus on creating content that's genuinely engaging and humorous, rather than pumping out mindless garbage for a quick buck. To sum it up, \"Disaster Lampoon-athon\" is best left unwatched and forgotten, a pitiful addition to the once-great National Lampoon name. Here's to hoping that the next attempt is a return to form for the iconic comedy brand.", "A 12-year-old boy who fell out of a five-storey window miraculously survived after landing on a car parked beneath the building.

'The car's windscreen was shattered and there was a lot of blood,' said the eyewitness. The receptionist added: 'The boy was conscious at the time and an ambulance was called to take him to the hospital. Someone said that he had fallen from the fourth floor. 'He's really lucky. If it wasn't for the car, he would not have survived.' Doctors at the Nanchang University Medical Hospital said that the boy did not have life-threatening injuries. The main injury was to his leg but he needed further observations. Nonvital injuries:Doctors said that the boy did not have life-threatening injuries but his leg was hurt . The boy's father said: \"I don't know how he fell out of the window but he said that he was sleepwalking.\" The Public Security Bureau is further investigating the incident. However, the owner of the car, Xiao Deng, doesn't feel so lucky. Scene of the incident: Neighbours noticed the fall when the boy was on top of the car and yelling for help . Deng was having dinner nearby and when he returned saw the damage to his car. He said that he bought the car just six months ago.

In contrast to VS and SU, WIV stimulated the production of the antibody subclasses IgG2a (Balbc) and IgG2c (C57BL6), considered to be particularly important for viral clearance, and activation of IFN-gamma-producing T cells. Similar to live virus, WIV stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines by conventional dendritic cells and IFN-alpha by plasmacytoid cells, while VS and SU had little effect on cytokine synthesis by either cell type. We conclude that vaccination with WIV in contrast to VS or SU results in the desired Th1 response presumably by induction of type I interferon and other proinflammatory cytokines.", "It is possible for octogenarians (individuals in their 80s) to develop infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease without traditional risk factors.

The renal hilum is the area where the blood vessels and ureter enter and exit the kidney. Clamping the renal hilum temporarily stops blood flow to the kidney during the surgery, which helps control bleeding and facilitates the removal of the cancerous tissue or affected part of the kidney. However, this also deprives the kidney of oxygen and nutrients. It is essential to minimize the time the renal hilum is clamped (called \"warm ischemia time to reduce the risk of kidney damage and preserve as much kidney function as possible. Prolonged warm ischemia time can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Surgeons are always aiming for the shortest possible clamping time to ensure the best patient outcomes.

While the stunning cinematography and immersive soundtrack may initially draw viewers in, it soon becomes apparent that these elements merely serve to distract from a disappointingly shallow plotline. The characters and their respective narratives feel flat and undeveloped, resulting in a lack of emotional connection for the audience. The film's pacing is another point of contention, as it often meanders between scenes without any clear direction, causing frustration for the viewer. And yet, despite its shortcomings, the undeniable allure of its European aesthetic and the flawless performances by the lead actors cannot be ignored. In conclusion, this film may be a feast for the eyes and ears, but it leaves the viewer craving a more satisfying entree in terms of story and character development.", "Yes, the aqueous humor is capable of both generating and degrading hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

City, whose current squad cost a total of 368million, host West Ham on Sunday but a Champions League spot next year is still in doubt with just four points separating them and fifth place Liverpool with six games to play. Eriksson, who was the last manager at City before the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour and his family, said they have underperformed given their financial clout. Yaya Toure wore a snood in training on Thursday despite it being the hottest week of the year . City were beaten 4-2 by fierce rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford last weekend . 'With the squad City have they should do better,' he said, 'I think they have the best players in the Premier League, so they should be the best team, but they are not. They are out of the Champions League again and it looks like they will not win the Premier League this year. Now they have to concentrate to finish in the top four. I don't know what is going wrong but with the money they have spent they have to do better. I suppose it is not good enough.' Almost 1billion has been spent in an attempt to turn City into a major force in Europe since the Mansour family took over in 2008. They have twice won the Premier League title since then and are current champions. But they are out of Europe, lost in the FA Cup to Middlesborough and have lost their last two league games, a painful 4-2 derby defeat to Manchester United and a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace. Eriksson, who is currently managing one of China's top teams Shanghai SIPG, said the owners will expect silverware every season. Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson (centre) managed City in the 2007-08 season . 'For these rich clubs whose owners invest a huge amount of money, they expect to win every year, but only one team can win the title. It is difficult to tell whether the players or manager is at fault because they won the league last year with the same players. It is hard to know what has made the difference this year. But City have come a long way in the last ten years. The year before I was there they were almost relegated. Now they have success and the fans should be happy. But expectations are high, and it is the same at Chelsea. They want their team to win all the time.'", "Iconic 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' Sign Celebrates its 62nd Anniversary LAS VEGAS, NV - The famous landmark of the magical city, the 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign stands tall as it completes 62 years this year. Designed in 1959 by local artist Betty Willis, the brightly lit sign has become synonymous with the allure and dazzling neon lights of Las Vegas. A significant part of the city's history and culture, it celebrates the illustrious past and the ever-evolving present of this glamorous metropolis. Located in the median of Las Vegas Boulevard, just south of the legendary Strip, this iconic sign has been a welcoming beacon for both tourists and locals visiting the city. Over the years, it has become one of the most photographed spots and a must-visit attraction for millions of visitors every year. In appreciation of its cultural and historical relevance, the 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, an honor that recognizes the sign's contribution to the city's famous landscape. One fascinating aspect of the historic sign is that it has no copyright, a rarity in our world of intellectual property rights. This deliberate choice by Betty Willis was intended as a gift to the people and the city of Las Vegas. Consequently, the sign's design has been imitated and adapted countless times, appearing on souvenirs, t-shirts, and posters, both within Vegas and worldwide, further solidifying its recognition as an emblematic symbol of the city. As Las Vegas continues to transform over the years, the 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign stands as a reminder of the city's roots in vintage glamor and a testament to the timeless joy and entertainment it has provided millions of visitors across generations.

This masterpiece of science fiction delves deep into the cosmic mysteries of human existence, and fearlessly pushes the limits of both narrative and visual storytelling. The film's plot is a slow burn, painstakingly tracing humanity's evolution from primitive apes to spacefaring explorers. Along the way, we're introduced to the enigmatic black monolith, an alien construct that seems to guide our progress and lead us towards our destiny among the stars. The film's groundbreaking special effects, including the iconic rotating space station and the mesmerizing \"Star Gate\" sequence, are a testament to Kubrick's ambition and creative genius. A noteworthy aspect of the film is its use, or rather, minimal use of dialogue. Instead, Kubrick relies heavily on visuals and the powerful orchestration of classical music to captivate the audience and enhance the emotional resonance of key scenes. One of the more famous components of the story is the character HAL 9000, the artificial intelligence aboard the Discovery One spacecraft. There is an unnerving air of tension as HAL 9000 gradually betrays its human crewmates, and the thematic implications of this, such as man's growing dependence on technology and the potential dangers of AI, are as relevant today as they were in 1968. 2001: a Space Odyssey is a cerebral and thought-provoking cinematic journey, at times enigmatic and bewildering, yet always stimulating and engaging. It forces viewers to ponder existential questions about our place in the universe, and the ultimate destiny of the human race. Kubrick's visionary epic may not be suited to everyone's tastes, but it remains a seminal work in the history of cinema, with a profound influence on science fiction storytelling and the art of filmmaking as a whole.", "Person1: Have you ever done this kind of work before?

A new report from Suncorp Bank suggests Australian's have spent 50 per cent more on digital devices than they planned in the last year. The report found Australians spent 20 billion on digital devices and services - or on average 2,300 each - on technology and communication devices in the last 12 months. A new report from Suncorp Bank suggests Australian's have spent 50 per cent more on digital devices than they planned in the last year, with mobile phone bills as the biggest expense . Men spent twice as much as women on computers, digital accessories, mobile apps, and streaming services. On average, men spent 2618 over the last 12 months, 475 more than women. The report also found that families with children living at home are spending 50 per cent more to stay digitally connected to the world than singles, couples without children and empty nesters. 'The report found adults without children living at home spent an average of 2,006 on technology and communication each year, while those costs ballooned to 2,993 per adult if they have at least one child under their roof,' said Suncorp Bank Regional Manager, Monique Reynolds. The report also found that families with children living at home are spending 50 per cent more to stay digitally connected to the world than singles, couples without children and empty nesters . Despite the mounting costs, the report revealed over one third of households don't budget for technology or wildly underestimate how much they will spend. Mobile phone bills were the biggest expense, and also the biggest disparity for families. 'Call and data plans for phones and internet were the largest single expense for households, and accounted for the greatest spending divide, costing 244 extra for families with children at home.' Despite the mounting costs, the report revealed over one third of households don't budget for technology or wildly underestimate how much they will spend.

The new pet GPS system allows owners to track their furry friends' journeys in real time, from monitoring the temperature below, to whether their cage is upright or askew. The first-of-its-kind technology was developed by Sendum Wireless Corp. and is available for 50 per flight from 10 US airports. Delta's new pet GPS, available for 50 per flight, allows owners to track their pets on a plane via a website . The move was no doubt aimed to make passengers feel safer about bringing their pets with them on flights, as Delta Air Lines has a less than rosy history of pet fatalities on board. Tragically between 2010 and 2013, Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths that year. They maintain that the high numbers are due to the fact they carry a higher number of pets than competitors. The service is available from 10 US airlines including Los Angeles and Atlanta . Two months ago it was reportedthat Delta failed to load a number of show dogs on a flight, and staff admitted they did not know where the prized pets were, when they were asked by customers. The dogs had been competing at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show in New York and were headed for Seattle. Angry passengers disembarked and were givena free overnight stay at a hotel near JFK, a refund of their 200 dog fees, VIP service at the airport and spots in the cabin for the dogs for the return flight to Seattle. It is hoped the Sendum Wireless Corp. technology, which has similar trackers for keeping tabs on alcohol and tobacco and to make sure seafood is kept cold, will give owners peace of mind during their travels.

From that time on, a great appreciation for Gershwin's music arose in me. I love the haunting melodies of this opera by Gershwin. Back when I was in 5th grade (around age 10), I got the LP to practice with and also love the soundtrack very much. I recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - an old, used LP. I have been searching and searching to try to find the soundtrack on CD. The songs on this have marvelous musical arrangements and I truly wish it would be put on CD for purchase and also wish they would restore the movie and put it on DVD. This is truly a great work that I think present and future generations would enjoy and benefit from. Some may think the movie slow and dull, but I find it quite the contrary. Although Poitier and Dandridge have dubbed musical voices, I think the voices fit the faces and personalities well. A person's speaking voice and singing voice may be quite different.

These substrates, also known as \"suicide probes\" or \"suicide substrates,\" are chemically modified versions of the normal DNA substrates that are involved in recombination reactions. They are designed such that they can begin the recombination process but are unable to complete it, often due to chemical modifications that make them vulnerable to cleavage by restriction enzymes or other types of nucleases. By using suicide substrates in recombination experiments with the bacteriophage lambda system, researchers have been able to gain insights into the molecular details of the homology-dependent steps of the recombination process, such as the requirement for homologous DNA sequences, the role of protein-protein interactions, and the mechanism of strand exchange. For example, experiments using suicide substrates have shown that the lambda integrase protein mediates the initial pairing of homologous DNA sequences and that the presence of a homology-dependent DNA annealing activity is essential for the recombination process to occur. These studies have also revealed that other proteins, such as the lambda Xis protein and the host integration host factor (IHF) play critical roles in the process. In summary, suicide substrates have been valuable tools for studying the intricate molecular details of the homology-dependent steps during integrative recombination of bacteriophage lambda and has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this essential biological process.", "\"Neither we satisfied nor they\" -users and provider's perspective: a qualitative study of maternity care in secondary level public health facilities, Uttar Pradesh, India is a research study that focuses on understanding the experiences and perspectives of both the users (women and their families) and providers (healthcare professionals) of maternity care services in secondary-level public health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India.

The director's ingenious approach to storytelling works wonders in drawing the audience in and keeping them captivated throughout the film. The plot, although not entirely unique, is executed masterfully, making even the most predictable plot twists seem fresh and compelling. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is sharp, and the pacing is just right, avoiding any lulls or drags in the narrative. While the acting may not be comprised of A-listers, the ensemble cast delivers superb performances, making the characters feel genuine and relatable. The chemistry between the lead actors is palpable, adding an extra layer to the emotional depth of the film. The cinematography is nothing short of impressive, turning every frame into a work of art, while the film's score elevates the atmosphere of each scene, effortlessly intensifying the emotional impact on the viewer. The film's only downfall might be its rather abrupt conclusion, leaving some loose ends untied and eliciting a mild sense of dissatisfaction. However, this minor blip is easily overshadowed by the overall triumph of the movie and its captivating storytelling. In conclusion, this low-budget gem proves that even with limited resources, a compelling story, passionate performances, and a creative approach to filmmaking can lead to an unforgettable cinematic experience. Highly recommended for all those who appreciate the art of storytelling and are not entirely dependent on high-budget special effects or star-studded casts to enjoy a film.", "In the treatment series the number of bifurcations per root area and per root length, specific root area (SRA) and length (SRL), areal (URR (area and length-based (URR (mass unit root rate and RGR decreased, and root tissue density increased relative to the control.

But i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. This movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word: \"RAW.\" There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, From the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis, and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context. Characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. I won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino \"bad ass\" provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other movies. Indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere; a reference to a movie is close around every corner. It is nice to see that each language presented (German, French, and English) is employed rather equally and naturally. I speak both French and English very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how English speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in EnglishAmerican movies act poorly. Amazingly enough, Tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps put the audience in context of the historical context. Indeed; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiersspiescivilians from other countries.The visualsphotography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe. The outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmicallyrealistically conveyed. No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. This makes the movie not open to all audiences; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good, that during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. I hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please.", "It's exactly what I expected from it. A rollercoaster ride of thrill, laughter, and sentimentality that never lets up. The film erupts onto the screen with jaw-dropping visuals, a bombastic soundtrack, and a star-studded cast that exudes charisma from every pore. As with its predecessors, our ragtag group of heroes embarks on a seemingly impossible journey, encountering both familiar faces and new adversaries along the way. The director masterfully balances humor and dramatic tension, allowing moments of levity to breathe amongst the chaos and uncertainty. Each character is granted their time to shine, proving that the whole ensemble is truly greater than the sum of its parts. The plot remains focused, avoiding unnecessary detours while still allowing for layers of emotional depth and resonance. The characters' motivations and vulnerabilities are poignantly human, grounding the spectacle in a sense of emotional reality that elevates the film beyond mere popcorn entertainment. The action sequences are breathtaking, with choreographed fight scenes, inventive set pieces, and a seamless blend of practical and digital effects. The inevitable climactic showdown is both thrilling and emotionally charged, leaving audiences with a satisfying conclusion to yet another chapter in this beloved franchise. But of course, the door is left open for future adventures, leaving us eagerly anticipating the next installment.

This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but neglectful and blind mother.

However, CDCD was originally thought to be distinct from SCD because of the absence of positive lipid staining and the presence of alcian blue staining consistent with glycosaminoglycans in the proband's cornea. Our recent investigation has revealed that corneal specimens from other patients with SCD have also demonstrated staining for glycosaminoglycans. Discovery that mutations in UBIAD1 caused SCD allowed genetic testing of this CDCD family. Our newly reported UBIAD1 mutation suggests that CDCD is actually a variant of SCD.

This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, \"By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead?\"Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the \"Claw\" or Saw. This movie is worth watching", "Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, \"Blade\" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dreadas minor as it may have beenfrom a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters? It may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, \"Blade\" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.", "This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result I've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices. Just keep in mind that it is a Barbie movie, and, though cheesy at times, in my experience, this one lives up to the high standard which the other Barbie princess movies have set for it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess. It teaches a good lesson as well. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.", "Ahem... How does one even begin to describe a film like \"Enigma of Delight\"? Never before have I witnessed such an enthralling exploration of the depths of human emotion. Director Natasha Clarke has woven a cinematic masterpiece, intertwining heartbreak and triumph, pain and joy. Through the characters of Mia (played by the brilliant Hailey Williams) and Chris (portrayed by the powerful James Dallas), we see the raw complexities of love, betrayal, and acceptance unravel before our eyes. The cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping vistas of unknown landscapes providing a vivid backdrop to the human drama unfolding. The ethereal music score composed by Sebastian Heart creates a sonic tapestry that enriches the visuals and elevates the scenes to an almost spiritual level. The cast delivers incredible performances, most notably Williams - whose raw vulnerability will undoubtedly lead to a well-deserved Oscar nomination - and Dallas, whose intoxicating magnetism surely solidifies him as a Hollywood A-lister. \"Enigma of Delight\" is not just a film; it is an experience that will linger with you long after the final credits roll, leaving you with an overwhelming urge to delve deeper into the complex web of human relationships.", "Person1: How did your company's fundraiser go?

Officers have warned that these toy eggs are 'likely to contravene food imitation safety rules,' as their appearance could easily lead to unsafe consumption by young children who mistake the toys for edible sweets. The alarm was raised after reports of the toys being found in local shops, prompting an investigation by Trading Standards authorities in the respective regions. The food imitation safety rules are applicable to any non-edible product that may be reasonably mistaken for food, and are in place to protect children from the risk of choking or poisoning. The said toy eggs are very similar to popular sugary chocolate treats, not only in their appearance but also their size, making the risk of consumption significantly higher. Trading Standards officers are currently working to track down the suppliers of these toy eggs and are urging retailers to remove any such products from their shelves immediately. Parents and guardians are also encouraged to be vigilant when shopping for toys, ensuring that any purchased items are safe and suitable for their children. A spokesperson for Trading Standards said, \"The primary concern with these toy eggs is the potential danger to young children who may accidentally mistake them for chocolate treats. To avoid any potential harm, we are working closely with retailers to remove any such products from sale and to ensure that they are securely destroyed.\" As the investigation continues, anyone with information that could assist in identifying the suppliers of these toy eggs is encouraged to contact Trading Standards immediately. The warning serves as a reminder for parents and retailers alike to ensure that toys purchased and stocked adhere to safety standards. By doing so, the risk of accidents and potential harm can be significantly reduced, promoting a safe and secure environment for children.", "Grabbed my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's nearing 4 am here), and because it's Norwegian, which I wanted to follow up with Dead Snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now. The movie, titled \"The Wave,\" seemed to be an intriguing addition to the natural disaster genre and I was curious to see a non-Hollywood take on it. To my surprise, \"The Wave\" struck a perfect balance between showcasing breathtaking landscapes and gripping human drama. Geologist Kristian, portrayed by Kristoffer Joner, and his family find themselves caught in the chaos as a massive rockslide triggers a colossal tsunami that threatens to engulf their small town of Geiranger. The film didn't shy away from showing the devastating effects of nature's wrath, making the viewer feel the tension and urgency at every moment. What made \"The Wave\" truly stand out though, was its focus on the emotional dynamics between the characters within the setting of a disaster. The film presented us with relatable characters trying to make life-impacting decisions on a moment's notice while desperately trying to save their loved ones. It was a refreshing change from the stereotypical Hollywood disaster movies that often seem to prioritize destruction and visual effects over their characters. The cinematography was also noteworthy, capturing the beauty of the Norwegian fjords and the raw power of the incoming wave. Coupled with a haunting score, \"The Wave\" managed to create an eerie atmosphere that kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. In conclusion, if you're looking for a disaster movie with a unique perspective and an emphasis on human connection, \"The Wave\" is worth watching. It may be a slow-burning Norwegian drama, but it packs a powerful punch and leaves you contemplating the fleeting nature of life.", "Person1: Excuse me, how can I get special discount coupons?

Clocking in at an impressive 57.92 seconds, Peaty shattered the previous record of 58.46 seconds, showcasing the fruits of his dedication and extensive training regime. The Olympian, who initially set the previous world record in 2015, expressed his elation as he emerged victorious from the pool's waters. \"I'm absolutely delighted that my hard work and training have paid off,\" said Peaty, amidst the cheers and applause of his supporters. \"This achievement is a testament to my commitment and passion for swimming, and I'm excited to see where my career will take me next.\" Peaty's record-breaking accomplishment did not come easily; it was the culmination of an intense and disciplined training regime. The 26-year-old swimmer had been rigorously honing his skills, maintaining a strict diet, and receiving expert guidance from his coaches, all in the pursuit of breaking his own world record. The swimmer's unwavering devotion is inspiring both his fellow athletes and aspiring swimmers across the globe, proving that hard work truly does pay off. His achievement is already resonating throughout the competitive swimming community, setting a new benchmark for future athletes to strive for. The previous world record-holder was also Adam Peaty, who set the mark at 58.46 seconds in 2015. This demonstrates Peaty's consistency and determination, as he continues to push himself and upend the expectations within the sport of swimming. Adam Peaty's latest achievement serves as an inspiration to the entire sports community, proving that, with dedication, passion, and hard work, personal bests can be broken and new heights can be reached. As we move forward and look towards the future achievements of this remarkable athlete, one thing is certain: Peaty shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.", "This has to be one of the most awfully scripted films I've ever seen. The dialogues were clunky, the characters one-dimensional, and the plot an incoherent mishmash of tired tropes and preposterous twists. At no point in the film was I ever able to connect with any of the characters, as they spouted insipid lines that seemed culled from a first draft screenplay written by an angsty teenager. Furthermore, the film seemed to have a never-ending parade of predictable moments, leaving me feeling more and more exasperated as the runtime dragged on. The acting was subpar at best, with most of the cast unable to squeeze even an ounce of emotion out of the paper-thin characters they were meant to portray. The direction left a lot to be desired, with awkward camera angles and jarring scene transitions. While the film did have some competently made action sequences, and the visual effects were decent, it wasn't enough to salvage this disaster of a movie. In the end, I was left feeling like my time had been wasted, and my intelligence insulted by this poorly crafted, utterly misguided attempt at entertainment. In conclusion, I can barely find a redeeming quality in this film, and I wouldn't recommend it to even the most ardent fans of the genre.

He said that plans for the series had yet to be finalised, adding: 'We'll have to see.' Sources at NBC said last week the network 'is buzzing' about The Gilded Age, which will focus on the robber barons and get-rich-quick industrialists such as Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor and John D. Rockefeller who accumulated gigantic fortunes in the late 19th Century. The source said scouts were seeking 'the American Downton', saying: 'One of the Vanderbilt mansions is a front-runner. Julian wants a month off after finishing Downton, but then it is full steam ahead.' NBC President Robert Greenblatt told a meeting of TV critics he hoped The Gilded Age would 'come to life sometime next season' - which could mean it is on air as early as September.

Floyd Maywether's sparring partner Jeremy Nichols gives a mock interview as Manny Pacquiao . 'J Flash' makes fun of the Filipino's faith, singing and claims his mother uses Voodoo . Mayweather uses a -200C kriotherapy chamber to help his recovery from training . Nichols mimics Pacquiao's Visayan accent while poking fun at the 36-year-old's decision to both write and perform his own entrance song as well as ridiculing the 'Pacman's' religious faith. The young boxer also takes a pop at Pacquiao's mother by claiming her 'voodoo powers' are the secret behind his success - so-called 'Mommy D' was accused of using Voodoo chants from ringside during her son's victory over Tomothy Bradley in April 2014. As a parting shot, Nichols refuses to refer to the fight's date in normal English and repeatedly says it will be staged on 'May two, May two!'. The up and coming boxer has not had a professional fight yet but insists he is ready for the challenge of getting Mayweather in prime shape before the contest. Mayweather takes part in a training session under the gaze of a packed media audience . Pacquiao and his coach Freddie Roach take part in a similar training session In Los Angeles . The unbeaten US fighter gets a light massage ahead of his workout in Las Vegas . Pacquiao is so popular in the Philippines that he is featured on the latest postage stamps . 'It's a blessing an opportunity to work with one of the biggest names in boxing,' he said. 'I want to make sure he knows there's someone ready to take over the 147lbs once he gets ready to hang up the gloves. 'It's a great experience and I've learned so much - I've switched my entire training regime around since I've been here. This opportunity is a blessing, I can't thank him enough for giving me the chance,' he added.", "Laboratory researchers, from ignorance or by design, often analyse their results before the final number of experimental units (humans, animals, tissues or cells) has been reached. If this is done in an uncontrolled fashion, the pejorative term 'peeking' has been applied. A statistical penalty must be exacted. This is because if enough interim analyses are conducted, and if the outcome of the trial is on the borderline between 'significant' and 'not significant', ultimately one of the analyses will result in the magical P 0.05. I suggest that Armitage's technique of matched-pairs sequential analysis should be considered. The conditions for using this technique are ideal: almost unlimited opportunity for matched pairing, and a short time between commencement of a study and its completion. Both the Type I and Type II error-rates are controlled. And the maximum number of pairs necessary to achieve an outcome, whether P 0.05 or P 0.05, can be estimated in advance.", "Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test next year for the first time in almost 30 years. Tutors are deciding whether to bring back the exams, which would be designed to select the exceptional applicants. The university said recent changes to the exams system made it more difficult to decide which students to admit. Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test next year for the first time in almost 30 years . According to trade magazine Schools Week, documents presented to senior tutors say the university is 'being forced' into changing its system of using AS-levels to assess applicants. The paper says that GCSEs 'will not give us a reliable measure' due to their ongoing reform and that 'schools' predictions of grades will be next to useless'. At present, the university uses unified mark scheme (UMS) scores calculated from students' performance in their AS-levels - which are known when they apply to university - to decide which applicants are invited to interview. But under coalition reforms planned to 'toughen up' the qualifications, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September and scores will no longer contribute to the overall A-level. The Labour party has pledged to halt the changes and retain AS-levels. University departments have now been asked for their views on a 'main proposal' to reintroduce the tests from the 2016-17 admissions round. Under coalition reforms planned to 'toughen up' the qualifications, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September . Mike Sewell, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: 'In the light of the recent A-level reforms, the university is in the process of considering all options available so that we may continue meeting our goal of admitting the best and brightest students from all backgrounds.' Oxford University already uses subject-specific aptitude tests. Most of its admission tests are organised by the Admissions Testing Service. The disclosure has been met with concern by school leaders, who said institutions with fewer resources may not be able to properly equip pupils for the tests. Eddie Playfair, principal of Newham Sixth Form College, London, said: 'There's a danger students in smaller sixth forms don't have the same resources and might lose out. 'It could be one more barrier in the way.'", "I have to admit, that out of the many many thriller movies I have seen, this has to be one of the worst. \"Disappointment: The Thriller\" (yes, that's what they really named it) had the potential to be a gripping, suspenseful mystery, but sadly missed the mark by a country mile. The plot felt contrived, the characters unconvincing and their motivations often confusing. Our protagonist, Sarah, seemed to have only one facial expression - one of mild terror - that was applied to every situation, whether it was discovering a fresh murder scene or simply burning her toast. The supporting cast, equally, felt like cardboard cutouts rather than three-dimensional humans. The storyline itself had the potential to be intriguing - a woman haunted by her past must solve a series of grisly murders she may or may not be responsible for. Unfortunately, the plot was riddled with holes and relied on laughably implausible coincidences to move the story along. As an audience member, I didn't feel invested in the story, nor did I feel any connection to the characters - if anything, I was mildly curious about how our heroine would escape her predicament. Visually, the film relied heavily on dimly lit sets and copious amounts of fog, presumably to create tension and mystery. Instead, it left the viewer straining to see what was happening and inadvertently praying for a break in the gloom. The only redeeming quality of \"Disappointment: The Thriller\" was its unintentional comedy factor. Cliched dialogue and melodramatic moments were a source of amusement, if not exactly enhancing the intended sense of peril. Not to mention the final twist that stretched the boundaries of believability so far even a seasoned moviegoer would be left incredulous. In conclusion, \"Disappointment: The Thriller\" is a subpar thriller that fails to deliver on its promises of suspense and intrigue. If it weren't for the unintentional laughs, the film would be utterly forgettable. Spare yourself the disappointment and choose another thriller to enjoy.", "Person1: Of course you can, but it just felt like you were asking more questions than usual.

Although the subcellular site (s) for reduced mGluR5 expression cannot be discerned from Western blot data, the quantitatively similar effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on mGluR5 agonist stimulation of presynaptically localized GAP-43 phosphorylation and CHPG potentiation of evoked D-ASP release suggest that the presynaptic nerve terminal is one site where prenatal ethanol exposure has reduced mGluR5 receptor number and function. Furthermore, these data implicate these neurochemical alterations as one factor contributing to the hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral deficits that we have observed previously in prenatal ethanol-exposed offspring.", "Acclaimed restaurant critic and festival curator, Leo Schofield, expressed his severe dissatisfaction with living in Tasmania, revealing it was the unhappiest time of his life. This comes as a result of a 25 government cut in funding to the festival he was setting up, which Schofield claims led him to develop acute depression. Schofield did not only lament the funding issue, but he also criticised the local Tasmanians for wanting to \"dig it up, chop it down, sell it to the Chinese\" - a sentiment that suggests their priorities are not in line with supporting the cultural projects Schofield aimed to create. However, a spokesperson for the state's Tourism Industry Council rebutted Schofield's claims, stating that his comments were \"blatant mistruths.\" As the tension between Schofield and the Tasmanians persists, it remains unclear how the situation will develop and whether Schofield's festival will gather the funding and support needed to prosper.", "A genome-wide SNP scan of pooled DNA can potentially reveal a nonsense mutation in FGF20 in the scaleless line of featherless chickens. FGF20 (fibroblast growth factor 20) is a protein-coding gene that plays a role in the development of feathers and scales in birds. A nonsense mutation in the FGF20 gene has been associated with the scaleless line of featherless chickens, where these birds lack normal feathers and have abnormal scaly skin. By conducting a genome-wide SNP scan of pooled DNA from featherless and normally-feathered chickens, researchers can compare genetic variations across the entire genome and identify specific SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with the featherless phenotype. If the FGF20 nonsense mutation is present in the scaleless line of chickens, this approach may well reveal its presence. However, it is important to note that a successful identification of the mutation would depend on the design of the study, the quality of the DNA samples, and the accuracy of the genotyping methods used in the analysis. Additionally, it would be useful to follow up on such a study with functional validation and investigation of the biological consequences of the identified FGF20 mutation in the context of feather and scale development.", "Person1: Would you like to go to the movies tonight?

Jose Mourinho didn't rule out a potential 12,000-mile round trip to Japan, home of new sponsors Yokohama Rubber, . No final decision has been made on a destination but if a tour goes ahead, the squad is likely to fly out on either May 28 or 29 for a two-match, week-long trip. Jose Mourinho did not rule out the prospect of a 12,000-mile round trip for a pre-season tour in Japan . The news may concern a string of international bosses who will be relying on Chelsea players for their mid-June friendlies and qualifiers. For instance, Belgium face France in a friendly on June 7 before a vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales on June 12. England, Spain and Serbia, who all have Chelsea players in their squads, all have games between June 12-14. Likewise, the proposed tour would also have implications for Chelsea's South American contingent, including Oscar, Willian and Juan Cuadrado, ahead of the Copa America on June 11. FIFA rules state that nations are entitled to players 14 days before the start of a tournament. It is highly likely that those players involved in the Copa America would be given permission to miss Chelsea's post-season tour. Chelsea are yet to finalise plans for their pre-season as they lead the way at the top of the Premier League . Mourinho said: 'I think we'll go on an after-season tour to play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the Premier League champions, if we win it. 'It's something we are thinking about, a good way to celebrate. Not a victory parade, but a trip, a week where we play a couple of matches but, at the same time, can be together without the pressure of winning every match, without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the Premier League. 'We can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling. But we still have nine matches to play. 'Mr Bruce Buck and the board are talking with me. We want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like Chelsea. 'Japan? I don't know but that would make some sense.'", "Jordan Spieth holds command at 2015 Masters as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods falter The 2015 Masters saw an inspired performance from young American golfer Jordan Spieth, who held onto a significant lead over seasoned opponents Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods. As the competition progressed, it was clear that 21-year-old Spieth was the one to watch, as he consolidated and extended his control over the famous Augusta course in resolute fashion. From the beginning, it appeared to be anyone's game, with McIlroy and Woods both making strong starts. However, they were no match for a determined Spieth, who, despite his young age, demonstrated his considerable prowess on the green. At the age of just 21, Spieth is one of the youngest golfers ever to have won the Masters. His single-minded focus and unyielding determination to succeed saw him raise the coveted Green Jacket, beating the odds in the process. While McIlroy and Woods were both early favorites, it was Spieth who ultimately emerged as the true champion. As he addressed the crowd after his victory, there was no denying the outpouring of both emotion and relief: \"I'm at a loss for words,\" he said. \"This is the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in the sport. It was very nerve-wracking today. I thought today might be a bit easier than it was.\" The 2015 Masters will certainly go down as an event that showcased the best of the sport, with Spieth's remarkable performance proving that, sometimes, tenacity and drive can overshadow even the most experienced and decorated of opponents. Looking ahead, as Spieth continues to cement his status as one of the world's best golfers, it's clear we can expect great things from this young talent, both on and off the course. As Rory McIlroy congratulated Spieth on his victory, he summed up the sentiment felt by many: \"It's a special moment for him, but I've got a feeling it's not going to be his last.\"", "Hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years, but none stranger than this. WHY this movie got made I will never know, nor how Paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in 1947. It is the strangest mix of genres I have seen in a long time, a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy.It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of Germany in the days just before WW II began. Ray Milland, a fine actor, is stuck playing the part like an escapee from Monty Python, all very exaggerated English prep-school dialogue. In Germany he meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps him to travel under cover as, of course, another gypsy. She plays her part like the typical Viennese operetta gypsy caricature, as do the other \"gypsies\" in the movie. But there are also Nazis, who are not funny at all. And then Milland finds he is starting to think like a gypsy, and that is not treated as a joke. Sometimes the music is for a light comedy, sometimes for a drama. Every time the Nazis show up, the film score plays Wagner, which is funny by itself.This movie could have been a comedy, or it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both are hinted at in this movie, but neither pursued. What we are left with is a truly strange mish-mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone (except the director) involved.Bizarre.", "Holy Schnikey! \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Marvin\" truly takes audiences on a wild ride they won't forget.

Fenerbahce's team bus came under fire as it made its way to Trabzon airport following their 5-1 victory against Caykur Rizespor. Two people have been detained by the police regarding the incident. The attack on the bus left the driver injured, and the bus heavily damaged. Images from the incident show multiple bullet holes in the front windshield and a shattered window next to the steering wheel. According to Fenerbahce vice-president Mahmut Uslu, the driver's quick thinking of diving after being shot to lie down saved his life. The suspension of football activities was announced by the Turkish Football Federation, with the president, Yildirim Demiroren, stating that all forms of football had been suspended for a week - leagues, national team games, and international club competitions. He added that everyone involved in the sport in Turkey is saddened by the incident, and he hopes that it serves as a turning point, teaching everyone how violence is not the answer. The detentions followed an extensive search for the people behind the attack, with police scouring the Surmene district where the shooters were located when they fired at the bus. The authorities say that they found 7.65-millimeter-diameter cartridges used in automatic weapons at the scene. The Turkish Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has pledged to apprehend the people behind the attack, calling it \"an attack against the national will.\" He added that the full force of the law would be used against all perpetrators.", "Manchester United duo Marcos Rojo and Angel di Maria celebrated their 3-1 triumph over Aston Villa by flying out to Lisbon on Easter Sunday.

Portugal is a familiar destination for both Rojo and Di Maria as they played for Sporting Lisbon and Benfica respectively before eventually joining United in the summer. Rojo made headlines for the wrong reasons on Saturday evening as the Mail On Sunday exclusively revealed he had an affair with fitness instructor Sarah Watson. She claimed Rojo had offered money to spend the night with him before eventually sleeping with the 25-year-old without knowing he was married with a young daughter. The 200,000-a-week Manchester United defender is said to have bombarded her with explicit messages and naked photos. Sarah Watson was determined to clear her name following blackmail allegations . Watson claims she was offered money to spend the night with Rojo (right) but declined . Watson claims she was offered 35,000 by a newspaper to sell the story about her affair with Rojo .

A new smartphone app called Scar Booth has sparked widespread criticism for its ability to superimpose bruises, cuts, and other injuries onto users' selfies. The app, which boasts that your friends will think you've suffered a \"painful beating,\" has been slammed by anti-violence and abuse charities for glorifying violence and making light of the suffering endured by countless victims. Scar Booth, available for download on both iOS and Android platforms, offers a range of realistic-looking injuries that users can apply to their selfies, including bloody noses, black eyes, and severe cuts. As a result, the app has drawn backlash from several organizations advocating against violence and supporting victims of abuse. \"It is absolutely disgusting that an app like this is being allowed to promote violence in such a nonchalant and trivial manner,\" said Emma Watson, a spokesperson for an anti-domestic violence charity. \"It makes a mockery of the terrible experiences faced by thousands of people who have suffered physical abuse at the hands of their loved ones or have survived violent attacks.\" Critics argue that Scar Booth not only glamorizes violence but also normalizes it to a certain extent, potentially contributing to an already growing culture of violence in our society. They also believe that the app's seemingly lighthearted approach might encourage impressionable youths to participate in violent behavior or to view violent images as entertaining or socially acceptable. The app's developers argue that Scar Booth is not designed to promote violence but rather to offer users an opportunity to engage in a fun and harmless activity. The creators maintain that the intention behind the app is to allow users to pull harmless pranks on their friends or to create dramatic images for film or stage makeup enthusiasts. However, this explanation has failed to satisfy the app's detractors, who claim that the potential for harm far outweighs any lighthearted benefits it might provide. \"As an organization that works with countless survivors of abuse, we know firsthand the emotional and physical scars that violent incidents can leave behind,\" said Samantha Ruiz of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \"It is deeply troubling that an app like this exists, seemingly trivializing the suffering of so many victims who are struggling to rebuild their lives.\" Despite the ongoing controversy and the calls for the app's removal from various app stores, Scar Booth remains available for download. It remains to be seen whether its popularity will wane as a result of the backlash or if users will continue to see it as a harmless form of entertainment. Regardless of the app's ultimate fate, the debate surrounding Scar Booth raises serious questions about our society's relationship with violence and the role that technology and social media play in shaping our perceptions of what is acceptable and what is not. In light of recent events, it could be beneficial for the tech industry to examine the potential impact of such applications on our society and consider adopting more stringent guidelines to prevent the promotion and normalization of violence in future apps and social media platforms.", "By retaining the intact olecranon by the TRAP approach, orthopedic surgeon can get adequate surgical exposure for fracture fixation and can use olecranon as a three-dimensional template to restore the articular fragments.

The 20-year-old has made 36 appearances for the Gunners so far this season and sees his club and international future playing centre back. Chambers has really adapted to the role as both a right-back and centre-back since joining Arsenal and has performed exceptionally well when called upon. He played a crucial part in Arsenal's 4-1 win against Liverpool last week and recently earned his first England cap against Norway in September 2014. Arsene Wenger has been impressed with the young talent and believes he has a bright future ahead. In a recent interview, Wenger talked highly of Chambers saying, \"I must say Calum has done extremely well. The fact that he can play in those two positions, at this level, and can be efficient and reliable defensively, very few people can do it, and he can do it.\" Arsenal fans will be excited to see if Chambers will continue his good run of form as the Gunners face Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday evening.

Titled 'Pulp Illusion,' this disappointing knock-off fails to capture the electrifying essence of Tarantino's cult classic. Despite attempts to recreate the complex narrative structure and witty dialogue that made Pulp Fiction unforgettable, 'Pulp Illusion' is nothing more than a poorly executed imitation that should be avoided by fans and casual viewers alike. The characters in 'Pulp Illusion' lack depth and charisma, making it impossible for the audience to invest in their fates. The plotline is convoluted, and not in the clever, post-modernist way Tarantino managed to accomplish. Instead, viewers will find themselves lost in a maze of confounding events and half-baked ideas that never come together in a satisfying manner. Moreover, the film's stilted dialogue and forced humor are a far cry from Pulp Fiction's sharp wit and memorable exchanges. 'Pulp Illusion' attempts to mimic Tarantino's iconic style, but ultimately delivers a series of cliched one-liners and cringe-inducing scenes that quickly become tiresome. Lastly, the cinematography and editing are subpar, lacking the artistry and flair that were so meticulously crafted in the original film. The action sequences fall flat and are riddled with unrealistic stunts and awkward choreography. It's clear that the creative team behind 'Pulp Illusion' does not possess the skill or vision to pay proper homage to the original film. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, do yourself a favor and avoid 'Pulp Illusion' at all costs. It's a glaring example of how cheap imitations fail to live up to their source material, tarnishing the reputation of a classic film while providing no entertainment value of their own.", "Yes, small intestinal transit time can be delayed in Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO is a condition where there is an excessive amount of bacteria in the small intestine, which can lead to various symptoms, such as bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nutrient malabsorption. Delayed small intestinal transit time refers to the slowed movement of food and waste through the small intestine. This delay can be caused by various factors, including alterations in gut motility, alterations in gut neurotransmitters, or nerve damage. When transit time is delayed, bacteria in the small intestine have more time to overgrow, ferment undigested food, and cause inflammation, which can further exacerbate the symptoms of SIBO. In some cases, treating SIBO may involve addressing the underlying factors causing delayed small intestinal transit time, such as specific medications to improve gut motility or addressing underlying conditions like diabetes or scleroderma that can contribute to slowed transit time.", "Person1: No problem!

The drama did not end there, as Dawn later shockingly revealed that she had been cheating on him. The episode, entitled \"My fiance is a womaniser but is he a cheat?\" aired on ITV during its weekday slot at 9.25 am. As the title suggests, the show is known for bringing personal relationship dramas to life in front of the cameras, but nothing could have prepared viewers for the gut-wrenching scene that unfolded during this particular broadcast. During the show, host Jeremy Kyle presented a seemingly heartfelt moment when Jamie got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend Dawn while the couple tried to work out their relationship troubles. Jamie expressed his love and dedication to Dawn in front of the audience, hoping that a surprise proposal would help to mend their strained relationship. However, the fairy-tale ending that Jamie envisioned quickly turned into a nightmare when Dawn unexpectedly threw the diamond ring back at him and stormed off the stage in tears. The cameras then cut to Dawn backstage, where she shockingly revealed that she had been unfaithful during their relationship. This revelation added a surprising twist to the heartache, as it had been Jamie who was initially accused of cheating. Throughout the episode, Dawn claimed that her boyfriend was a womanizer and the couple had appeared on the show to determine whether or not he was cheating on her. The audience and the host were left stunned by the turn of events, as the chaotic and emotionally-charged episode came to an end. While it is uncertain where the couple's relationship stands after this tumultuous proposal, fans of \"The Jeremy Kyle Show\" will no doubt continue to watch in anticipation of the next drama to unfold on ITV's hit morning talk show.", "Man Shoots Girlfriend Following Lottery Dispute, Ends in Double Tragedy In a tragic turn of events, Terry Martin, 48, fatally shot his girlfriend Laurice Hampton on Saturday following a heated dispute regarding their lottery ticket winnings. Hampton managed to call 911 to report the shooting just moments before her death. Officers responding to the 911 call found the couple inside a master bedroom where Martin was already dead, presumably from suicide. Hampton, still clinging to life, was rushed to a local hospital by ambulance, but sadly succumbed to her injuries hours later. The couple had allegedly been arguing over the proceeds from a lottery ticket they had won together. Authorities have not released any information about the amount of the winnings, but the heated argument escalated to the point of fatal violence. Friends and family of the couple are in shock and mourning over the senseless double tragedy. One friend described Terry and Laurice as a \"loving couple,\" and no one saw this tragic outcome coming. As the investigation continues, authorities are working to develop a clearer timeline of events leading up to the deadly dispute. The incident serves as a grim reminder of the dangers of heated disputes, as well as the potentially devastating consequences that can come from the immense pressure generated by sudden financial gains.", "Our findings indicated that OATP 1B1 A388G polymorphism has a notable influence on the serum bilirubin level in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia patients. The OATP 1B1 521T allele may be a potential risk factor of such disease. OATP 1B1 T521CA388G was an important polymorphism gene which related with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Future study should involve other polymorphisms of OATP 1B1, more candidate genes and environmental risk factors.

The association between prolonged SBTT and positive LBT may be useful in identifying those patients with SIBO diagnosed by LBT and potentially target therapeutic options for those refractory to standard therapy. Interestingly, patients with positive LBT did not necessarily have a generalized gastrointestinal motility (similar GETs among groups), suggesting that small bowel transit specifically predisposes to the development of SIBO. Future, prospective studies are needed to further characterize intestinal dysmotility and other contributing pathophysiological mechanisms in SIBO and to investigate the potential benefits of prokinetics in this challenging patient population.", "Kevin Pietersen re-signs for Surrey in hopes of England recall Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has re-signed for Surrey in a bid to earn a recall to the national side. He announced his return to the county cricket team on Twitter, stating he will make his return to batting for Surrey on Monday. Pietersen, who is currently in Dubai for a cricket commentators' stint, tweeted on Friday: \"Can't wait to get back to surreycricket on Monday!\" While it's unclear if he will be able to make an immediate impact on his return, Pietersen has regularly expressed his desire to represent England again. However, his chances of an England recall remain slim, with coach Peter Moores having previously said Pietersen \"isn't on the radar\" for the national team. The 39-year-old batsman has not played for England since 2014, when he was dropped from the side following a disastrous Ashes tour in Australia. Pietersen will hope to impress in the domestic circuit with a strong showing for Surrey, in the hope that it could open the door to a possible England comeback. He has amassed 8,181 Test runs in his 104-match career and has made no secret of his desire to add to that tally in an England shirt. Surrey fans will be delighted with the return of one of their favorite players, who first joined the club in 2010 and has made sporadic appearances over the years. In addition to his international exploits, Pietersen has been a prolific run-scorer in domestic T20 cricket, representing numerous franchises around the world. It remains to be seen whether Pietersen's return to Surrey will be enough to force his way back into the England setup. However, with a wealth of experience and a proven track record on the biggest stage, he will certainly provide a boost to Surrey's ambitions in the upcoming season. While it's unclear if he will be able to make an immediate impact on his return, Pietersen has regularly expressed his desire to represent England again.", "I found it charming! The movie not only exceeded my expectations but also managed to address some serious themes without losing its delightful essence. The protagonists have a captivating chemistry that keeps you hooked, while the witty banter and heartfelt dialogues genuinely make you care for the characters. Visually, the movie is a treat, with gorgeous cinematography and stunning locations that further enhance the plot. The beautiful color palette and the seamless blend of fantasy and reality make it a delightful journey from start to finish. Moreover, the director's clever use of symbolism throughout the film gives it a depth that warrants multiple viewings. The original score adds to the movie's charm with its upbeat and soothing melodies that aptly set the mood for every scene. Furthermore, the soundtrack boasts an eclectic mix of well-curated songs that fittingly complement the story. As for the acting, the ensemble cast delivers a powerhouse of performances, encapsulating the vulnerability and strength of the characters. The supporting actors, too, play their roles with impeccable timing, providing the perfect amount of humor and emotion when needed. While the film's pacing may have its highs and lows, the overall narrative is engaging, and the well-placed twists ensure that you stay invested in the story. It's not often that a movie can make you laugh, cry and think at the same time, and this one does it all effortlessly. In conclusion, this movie is a refreshing, enchanting, and insightful experience wrapped in a beautiful package. One would surely not want to miss out on such a unique and uplifting cinematic gem.", "I give this movie a 4 cause I'm a die-hard fan of the video game series. Having played the games for years, I had high expectations going into this film adaptation. Though it didn't live up to the complete thrill and detailed storytelling of the original video games, it managed to capture the essence of the gaming experience in a way that was visually stunning and captivating. The acting was solid, and I appreciate that the filmmakers stayed true to the spirit of the game's characters, which made it feel more authentic. The action-packed sequences were well-executed and drew me in, keeping the adrenaline pumping throughout the movie. The CGI effects were also impressively realistic, effectively transporting viewers to the familiar virtual realms. However, the plot fell somewhat short and could have benefited from a more robust and intricate story arc. At times, it felt like the focus on the action sequences took away from the storytelling, leading to a less emotionally engaging experience. The pacing was also a bit uneven in some parts, making it feel rushed in areas where it should have given more time to build tension and suspense. Overall, fans of the video game series will surely find something to enjoy in this adaptation while newcomers may feel a little lost amidst the action and gamer jargon. It's definitely worth a watch for its homage to the source material, as it manages to stay true to its roots.", "Aston Villa prodigy Jack Grealish has attracted the attention of both the Republic of Ireland and England, leading to a heated debate over his international future. However, Villa manager Tim Sherwood has urged the 19-year-old to focus on playing more games for Villa in the meantime. Grealish, who was born in Birmingham, qualifies to represent both nations due to his Irish grandparents. He has previously played for Ireland at under-17, under-18 and under-21 levels, but has yet to make a senior international appearance. Irish manager Martin O'Neill is especially eager to secure the talents of Grealish, stating that he would love for the young star to play for the Irish national team. However, England manager Roy Hodgson is also reportedly keen on recruiting Grealish. Tim Sherwood, who managed Grealish during his time at Villa, has stressed that the midfielder's main concern should be securing more playing time at the club level and not rushing into a decision regarding his international future. \"For Jack, it's just about playing football matches. He needs to play more games,\" Sherwood said. Grealish has decided to make a decision over his international future at the end of the season, giving him ample time to prove himself on the field for Villa. Fans of both the Irish and English national teams will be eagerly awaiting his decision, as the talented youngster continues to show promise in his fledgling career.", "Using both RNA sequencing and real time PCR, we examined the association of STAT5A and STAT5B mRNA expression with CYP and TF gene expression. While STAT5A demonstrated significant negative correlations with expression levels of multiple hepatic TFs (including NR1I2 and HNF4) and CYPs (eg. CYP3A4, CYP2C19), STAT5B expression was observed to demonstrate positive association with most of the CYPsTFs analyzed suggesting that STAT5A and STAT5b have potentially different and distinct roles in regulating expression of hepatic drug response genes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential roles of STAT5A and 5b in regulation of CYPsTFs and the potential implications of these findings.", "A recent poll has found that 45 of Britons have lied about their spending habits to their partner, highlighting the issues surrounding financial transparency in relationships. The same study also discovered that one in four Britons do not fully disclose how much they spend on themselves. In response to these findings, experts from the Money Advice Service are urging couples to have more open conversations about their finances. The poll, conducted by OnePoll, surveyed 1,000 adults across the UK and revealed that people are avoiding discussing money with their significant other for fear of causing arguments or embarrassment. The ongoing lockdowns may have intensified these concerns, as many households face increasingly strained budgets due to furloughs and job losses. The Money Advice Service has emphasised the importance of trust and financial transparency within relationships. \"Finances should not be a taboo subject, and being open about money can help to avoid needless stress and strain on a relationship,\" urged a spokesperson for the service. The study also noted that 26 of those surveyed admitted to having secret stashes of cash hidden from their partner, while 22 confessed to using hidden bank accounts to cover their spending. The Money Advice Service suggests that couples take time to establish a financial plan together in order to reduce potential arguments and build trust. Additionally, the service recommends setting financial goals as a couple, establishing boundaries on shared expenses, regularly reviewing household budgets, and having frequent, open discussions about money. Experts argue that couples who maintain a strong level of financial transparency often enjoy healthier relationships and are less likely to encounter conflicts over money matters. \"Being honest about your finances with your partner can help to identify and work towards joint and individual goals, while avoiding any potential mistrust in the future,\" said a spokesperson for the Money Advice Service. As the ongoing pandemic continues to impact economic stability for households across the UK, it is crucial for couples to work together to successfully manage their finances and ensure trust and honesty prevail in their relationships.", "The Mod Squad gets started 'after' the formation of the 'Mod Squad' without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are doing. Moreover, most of the events in the movie seem ancillary to the plot. This lack of backstory and development leaves the audience with little to no emotional investment in the characters, making it difficult to root for them or care about the outcome of the story. The acting is subpar, as the cast seems disconnected from the poorly-written dialogue and their characters' motivations. It seems that even the stars of the show don't have a clear understanding of the script, resulting in wooden and uninspired performances. Visually, the film does little to engage the viewer. There is an overreliance on cliche action sequences and predictable plot twists that fail to provide any real excitement or intrigue. Worst of all, the editing and direction leave much to be desired, as the story is barely strung together in a haphazard manner. In conclusion, The Mod Squad falls flat in almost every aspect. While the premise had potential, it was sadly squandered due to weak character development, lackluster acting, and generic visuals. This underwhelming crime-action film is certainly one you can pass on.", "On the cusp of being insufferable, director John Doe's latest experimental film, \"A Dance with Chaos,\" narrowly escapes the abyss of obnoxious self-indulgence. The film, centered around an eccentric artist named Vincent and his desperate quest for inspiration, walks a tightrope between creativity and lunacy. The film shines in its technical aspects, particularly its vibrant color palette and dynamic cinematography. Cinematographer Jane Smith masterfully captures the swirling chaos of Vincent's mind, his feverish attempts at creating something profound, and the moments of clarity when he does. The saving grace of \"A Dance with Chaos\" comes in the form of its lead actor, Tom Brilliant. Brilliant carefully avoids the caricature of the tortured artist and delivers an accessible and moving portrayal of a man on the verge of genius and madness. Through Brilliant's empathetic performance, we witness firsthand the devastation of raw talent in conflict with a lack of inspiration. However, the film's potential is bogged down by its image-heavy and dialogue-light nature. Due to this, the intended contemplative nature of the film often becomes frustrating, as certain scenes create more confusion than intended. The secondary characters, though portrayed by an ensemble of talented actors, seldom lend meaningful support to Vincent's story, often coming off as merely decorative. The absence of meaningful character interactions is more irritating than artistic, as the film would have benefitted from deeper explorations of the relationships between Vincent and his muses. Despite its shortcomings, \"A Dance with Chaos\" has its moments: scenes where the camera, colors, and talented cast come together to create something extraordinary. However, one can't escape the feeling that the film was merely a brushstroke away from crossing into the realm of insufferable.", "It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz.

The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: \"Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service.\" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of is Hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S.

This victory makes Djokovic the first player to win the opening three ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events of the year, after previous successes in Indian Wells and Miami. The 30-year-old Serbian athlete continues to showcase his prowess on the courts, with a current tally of 34 career Masters 1000 titles. Djokovic had to face down tough competition on his way to Sunday's victory over Berdych, having triumphed over clay court specialist Rafael Nadal in a thrilling semifinals match. Despite the difficult path to the final, Djokovic ultimately proved his dominance in the world of tennis. \"I don't take anything for granted, even though I won last year in Monte-Carlo, this year I had some tough matches,\" Djokovic remarked after his victory. \"I am very proud, as well as my team, for the achievement.\" Fans and analysts alike eagerly await the upcoming clay court season, where Djokovic aims to earn his first title at the French Open, the only major championship to elude him thus far. The Monte Carlo victory is a promising sign for the tennis star as he heads towards Roland Garros. \"I am aware of the challenge that is ahead of me in the French Open,\" said Djokovic. \"I am not the only one who wants to win that title, but I believe in my ability.\" As the 2022 clay court season begins, the world of tennis looks forward to witnessing what incredible achievements Djokovic will accomplish next.", "Forget helicopters and BMWs, could the ultimate symbol of wealth be clothes made from gold?

A poorly executed plot and cartoonish characters consistently undermine any potential the film might have had. Though it's always a pleasure to see Bullock grace the screen, her talents are utterly wasted in this laughably absurd story. As much as the script tries to build tension and excitement, it's impossible to take anything seriously as the audience is repeatedly thrust into a whirlwind of unrealistic action sequences and a excessive barrage of explosions. The cinematography and special effects are dated and don't hold up well; the action scenes play out like an amateur's attempt at copying the thrills of slicker films in the genre. The supporting cast struggle to contend with the film's shortcomings, but their performances are ultimately overshadowed by the shoddy writing and direction. Throughout the entirety of the movie, one can't help but feel as if it's a missed opportunity - not just for Sandra Bullock's acting prowess, but for what could have been an interesting concept if set in more capable hands. In conclusion, this film is best left as a curious footnote in Bullock's illustrious career. Save yourself the time and go watch one of her later, much better vehicles where her screen presence and talent shine. This failed action flick holds nothing more than the painful reminder that even future big-time Hollywood starlets had to start somewhere.", "Person1: You should have seen the line at the housing office.

The show does a fantastic job of balancing the drama of interpersonal relationships with the excitement of high-stakes performances. The contestants display admirable vulnerability as they expose their true selves to the world, creating a sense of authenticity that fans of reality television will truly appreciate. The show's producers also did a great job of finding a star-studded panel of judges who, much like those of \"American Idol,\" treat contestants with support, respect, and occasional tough love. This dynamic is a refreshing change of pace from other singing competitions and adds to the overall entertainment value of the series. One of the best aspects of \"The One\" is the fantastic array of musical genres and themes that the contestants dive into. Unlike \"American Idol,\" which often sticks to the safer side of pop culture, \"The One\" embraces the daring and displays outstanding performances in styles such as rock, RB, country, and even some international sounds. This offers great variety, week after week, keeping the viewer constantly entertained and engaged. \"The One\" might not reinvent the reality TV wheel or be entirely immune to the occasional cliche, but it does find a way to refresh the established formula and bring something fresh to reality television fans. The drama is tolerable, the talent is impressive, and the show is a fun ride for fans of singing competitions and with a taste for interpersonal conflict. In the end, \"The One\" lives up to the hype and cements itself as a worthy addition to the reality TV landscape.", "I picked this DVD up for 3.99 at Rogers Video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free. To my pleasant surprise, \"Bargain Bin Bonanza\" turned out to be quite the hidden gem. As the title suggests, it follows a group of eccentric, down-on-their-luck strangers who are united by their quest to find gold in the unlikeliest of places: the discount bin of a local video store. Featuring quirky twists and turns along with a solid ensemble cast that boasts a number of surprisingly endearing performances, this indie comedy-drama provided much-needed levity and heart. While the film initially seemed to hinge on the irony of its premise, it quickly transformed into a tale of friendship, hope, and the power of shared passions. Cinematography-wise, the film also stood out with an understated style that celebrates the familiar, nostalgic charm of suburban America. The soundtrack cleverly mixed iconic tunes from the classic movies featured within the story, effectively amplifying the characters' love for film and playing into the shared sentimentality of movie buffs in the audience. \"Bargain Bin Bonanza\" certainly isn't without its flaws - the pacing occasionally falters, and the film veers dangerously close to predictability at times. However, its offbeat charm, earnest storytelling, and lively characters more than make up for these shortcomings, resulting in a delightful viewing experience that leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling. In summary, while I initially picked up \"Bargain Bin Bonanza\" with the intention of merely scoring extra points for a free movie, I unwittingly discovered a delightful, heartwarming gem that I now hold dear. It's a wonderful reminder that sometimes, the best treasures can be found in the most unexpected places - and for 3.99, it's definitely worth giving a chance.", "Person1: That's a good idea, but I just don't have the time to copy them today. Would it be possible for me to meet you in the cafeteria and take a few quick pictures of the notes instead? Person2: Sure, that works for me. Let's meet in the cafeteria during lunch break. Just make sure to take the pictures quickly so I can review them as well. Person1: Sounds great, thank you so much, Maggie! I really appreciate it. Person2: No problem, happy to help. See you at lunch then!", "The tibia first technique with tensor measurement can be useful in predicting the soft tissue tension after implantation in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). The technique involves using a tensor to measure the ligament balance and correct any varusvalgus alignment of the knee while performing the tibial cut. This technique aims to restore the native soft tissue tension of the knee joint after joint replacement surgery. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of accurate ligament balancing and proper soft tissue tension for the overall success, function, and durability of UKAs. The tibia first technique with tensor measurement allows the surgeon to adjust the implant position and soft tissue tension to achieve a more balanced and better-functioning knee joint. This, in turn, may lead to a more successful outcome and improved patient satisfaction. However, more research and clinical studies are needed to determine the overall effectiveness of the tibia first technique in predicting the precise soft tissue tension following UKA, as well as the potential impact of various surgical approaches, implant designs, and individual patient factors on soft tissue tension and overall joint function.", "Secondary operators, typically trauma surgery attendings, traumacritical care fellows, or senior surgical residents, function as mentors in academic institutions and act as role models. Secondary operators participated in many of the studied cases, yet failed to demonstrate consistent use of MBP. In elective central venous catheter placement, those where there was the greatest opportunity to follow MBP, we observed a statistically significant difference in compliance rate between the primary and secondary operators. The study suggests the need to address the performance of the secondary operators and to educate them, as although they may be technically experienced in placing central venous catheters, they may comply less consistently with MBP.", "Developing a kidney transplantation program using the inverted funnel approach involves starting with a broad perspective and gradually narrowing it down to specifics. Here is a step-by-step guide to establishing a kidney transplantation program using this approach: 1. Define the scope and goals: Start by identifying the primary goals and objectives of the kidney transplantation program, such as increasing the number of transplants performed, improving patient outcomes, and expanding access to care. Determine the necessary resources and infrastructure to support these goals, taking into account factors such as staffing, funding, and facilities. 2. Research and analyze existing programs: Examine existing kidney transplantation programs, both nationally and internationally. Identify best practices and successful models that can be adapted for your program, as well as any potential challenges or barriers that may need to be addressed. 3. Engage stakeholders: Establish relationships with key stakeholders, including transplant centers, nephrologists, patients, donor organizations, and regulatory authorities. Involve them in the planning and development process to ensure that their perspectives are considered and to foster collaboration. 4. Develop a strategic plan: Based on your research, stakeholder input, and identified goals, create a comprehensive strategic plan that outlines the steps necessary to establish and maintain a successful kidney transplantation program. This plan should outline specific objectives, timelines, and milestones, as well as the roles and responsibilities of all involved parties. 5. Implement the program: Begin implementing the kidney transplantation program according to the strategic plan, making any necessary adjustments based on feedback and available resources. This may include hiring staff, establishing partnerships, acquiring equipment, and developing educational and outreach campaigns. 6. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly track and analyze key performance indicators, such as the number of transplants performed, patient outcomes, and program growth. Use this information to refine and improve the program. 7. Build partnerships: Develop and maintain relationships with other organizations and professionals in the transplantation field, including collaborations with other transplant centers, networking with professionals, and participating in conferences and research initiatives. 8. Advocate for improved kidney transplant policies: Work with stakeholders and policymakers to advocate for improved policies and public awareness around kidney transplantation, such as increasing organ donor registrations and promoting living donor transplants. 9. Continuous improvement: Ensure that the kidney transplantation program remains up-to-date with the latest clinical advancements and technologies, and continually adapts and refines its processes to maximize patient outcomes and efficiency. By following this inverted funnel approach, a kidney transplantation program can be established in a systematic and logical manner, with a focus on achieving the program's specific goals while taking into account the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders.", "Rare African Cat Gives Birth to Three Cubs at Columbus Zoo The Columbus Zoo in Ohio has welcomed an incredibly rare Amur tiger cub trio into the world. Ten-year-old Irisa, the mother of the cubs, was confirmed pregnant earlier this spring after several unsuccessful breeding attempts. The birth was smooth, with each of the cubs weighing 2.5 pounds at birth. The newborns are expected to grow to 650 pounds each. Zookeepers at the Columbus Zoo reported that while Irisa had bred before, she had never successfully conceived. The successful pregnancy and multiple births were a pleasant surprise to zoo staff. The zoo's animal husbandry team was involved in the breeding program that helped Irisa carry the three cubs to term. However, all was not without complications: zookeepers found that Irisa failed to show any maternal care for her newborn cubs. As a result, the staff stepped in, and the babies are now being hand-reared in incubators by the zoo's experienced animal care team. While it's still early days for the new additions to the zoo, the cubs are said to be doing well, thanks to the dedicated team at the Columbus Zoo. As they continue to grow, the trio will be given enrichment items and appropriate care to ensure their health and happiness. \"We are extremely proud and excited to announce the birth of the Amur tiger Cubs,\" said Columbus Zoo President and CEO, Tom Stalf. \"Our dedicated team continues to provide these cubs with the best care possible in order to ensure their survival and help them thrive. The cubs are doing well, and we look forward to watching them grow.\" The birth of these three rare Amur tiger cubs is significant for the species' survival. Amur tigers, native to Asia, are endangered, with between 360 and 470 animals estimated to remain in the wild. Habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict are some of the primary factors contributing to the decline in the Amur tiger population. The Columbus Zoo is involved in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) for Amur tigers. The primary goal of this program is to establish healthy, genetically diverse populations of tigers within accredited institutions to serve as an insurance population and source for potential reintroduction efforts in the future. The birth of these three cubs is a milestone for the AZA's program, as it marks a significant step forward in the ongoing effort to protect Amur tigers and ensure their continued existence.", "Person1: It's a lovely day, isn't it? Person2: Yes, the weather sure is nice today. Person1: I love it when the weather is like this. Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch? Person2: That sounds like a good idea. The sky is clear, the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze, so it is not too hot. Person1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado. but I must admit, this sure is a nice spring day. Person2: Hey, this spot in the shade looks really comfortable. Person1: Okay. Hey, is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all? Person2: I don't think so. I saw the weather report last night, and it said the weather should be fine all day.

Minocycline may also lower the self-perpetuating cycle between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of tau and A to act as a neuroprotector. Therefore, the ability of minocycline to modulate inflammatory reactions may be of great importance in the selection of neuroprotective agents, especially in chronic conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.", "Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds' best efforts. Directed by and starring Reynolds, the film manages to blend action, suspense, and dark humor without losing its core appeal. Reynolds' portrayal of Tom Sharky, a tough, determined, and unconventional detective, allows him to showcase his acting chops while keeping the audience invested in the plot. The story follows Sharky as he gets demoted to a vice squad and embarks on a mission to expose and eliminate a corrupt political candidate. Brimming with twists and turns, the tightly knit script never loses steam. The stellar supporting cast, which includes Rachel Ward, Vittorio Gassman, and Brian Keith, significantly contributes to the film's allure. Visually, the movie delivers as well, with fantastic cinematography capturing the dark corners and hidden danger lurking in the city. The high-octane action sequences are superbly executed, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the film. The soundtrack, featuring a blend of jazz and blues, elevates the mood, adding another layer of depth to an already compelling story. A crucial aspect of Sharky's Machine is its exploration of redemption not only for Reynolds' character but for other members of the vice squad as well. The story shines a light on the struggles and challenges faced by law enforcement and allows viewers to find themselves connecting and sympathizing with characters that may not be entirely likable. Overall, Sharky's Machine is a criminally underrated thriller that proves Burt Reynolds was more than just a charming action star. With its compelling narrative, unforgettable performances, and pulsating action, Sharky's Machine is a must-watch for fans of both Burt Reynolds and gritty, character-driven crime films.", "Southampton striker Graziano Pelle insists his confidence hasn't been destroyed despite no scoring in the Premier League since December 20. The 29-year-old, who netted against England for Italy in the 1-1 international friendly on Tuesday, is now hoping to return to the form that saw him plunder eight goals in his first 17 league games. The former Feyenoord star has thanked Saints fans for continuing to support him through his lean spell, while manager Ronald Koeman has backed Pelle to go on a run during the final eight games of the campaign. Graziano Pelle remains confident despite not scoring in his last 13 Premier League games . The Italy striker celebrates after netting the opener in Tuesday's 1-1 friendly draw with England . 'I was happy to play in a nice stadium it's a great team to play against. I like those games. I was happy, especially because I scored,' he told Southampton's official website. 'For Southampton I got the chances, but I didn't profit about it. I'm not a person who thinks negative. I have a great job and all I can do is work more and more when something is going wrong. 'That way I can achieve what I want to do. When you perform well the goals can come. It's not only about scoring the goal, I want to do well for the team in general. Pelle last scored in the Premier League during Southampton's 3-0 defeat of Everton on December 20 . 'I'm really happy for the support they give me. I said I have to try and bring the supporters to my side when I joined, in the beginning not many people knew me. 'I did well and then everyone was behind me. Then it has gone a bit wrong and some people can think he's not good enough, but the stadium every time they make me feel good. 'I have to say thanks to them, I want to do my job as good as possible. I'm double happy if I score but I just want to think about the future, we have eight games left.'", "Honesty is key in any relationship - but almost half of us lie to our partners about our finances, a study has revealed. Forty-five per cent of Britons have lied about their earnings, spending, bills or credit cards. And 41 per cent said they were in the dark about their partner's finances. Around one in five have lied to a partner about what they earn, with 10 per cent of those surveyed having understated their salary, four per cent having overstated it and another four per cent admitting to lying in both ways. The survey by financial guide Money Advice Service found 45 per cent of Brion have lied about their earnings, spending and credit cars, and 41 per cent of people surveyed din't know how much their partner earned . Of those who downplayed their wages, the main reason was to spare the feelings of a partner who earned less. However some said they lied to make sure their partner was with them for the right reasons - and not because of their bank account. The majority of insecure workers who exaggerated their salary to a partner because they didn't think they would stand a chance otherwise. Not wanting a partner to think they earned more came in second. The research by financial guide Money Advice Service also found that 24 per cent lied to their partners about what they spend on themselves. For women clothes were the biggest reason for lying, with 66 per cent fibbing about the cost of their wardrobe, while for men, technology purchases had caused 27 per cent to lie. The main reason for lying, the survey found, was to spare the feelings of a partner who earned less . Of the women who lied about how much they spend on themselves, two-thirds weren't honest with their partners about how much they spent on clothes and shoes. One in four men lied about technology purchases . Nick Hill, from Money Advice Service, says: 'For many couples, honesty is key to their relationship, but our research shows that many people hide the truth from their other half. 'Some people are comfortable telling their partner the truth about their finances, while others opt to hide their income or spending in order to avoid having a difficult conversation. 'The important thing to take away from this research is that money should not be a taboo subject within a relationship. 'It is vital to know where you stand in order to protect your finances both during a relationship and when coming out of one and you'll feel much more positive, open and honest about your relationship as a result.'", "(CNN) Australia, an important ally of the United States, has agreed to share some of its intelligence with Iran. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the deal is \"an informal arrangement\" with an emphasis on tracking Australians who go to Iraq to fight for ISIS. But one Australian lawmaker reportedly described the move as \"dancing with the devil.\" Over the weekend, Bishop became the first Australian government minister to visit Iran in 12 years, meeting with President Hassan Rouhani. The intelligence-sharing deal was announced in an interview released Monday that Bishop gave to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation while in Tehran. \"During my discussions with the national leadership here, it was agreed that we could share intelligence, particularly on the foreign terrorist fighters from Australia who are taking part in this conflict in Iraq,\" she said. The Iranians \"were very agreeable to share that information with us,\" she added. Like many Western nations, Australia is grappling with the problem of citizens who are choosing to travel to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Australia is part of the U.S.-led coalition that's carrying out airstrikes against ISIS. During the fight against the Sunni extremist group, the coalition has found its interests aligned at times with those of Iran, a Shiite-majority nation that has strong ties with the Iraqi government. Iran-backed Shiite militias played an important role in the recent battle to take the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS jihadists. \"Iran has a long standing relationship with Iraq, and as you point out, they have a very strong military presence there. They also have an influence over the Shia militia who are operating within Iraq,\" she said. \"So they are in Iraq, in places that we are not. They also have a very sophisticated intelligence network and they have a lot of information that they've been gathering.\" Bishop, who left Tehran on Sunday, declined to give details of the agreement with Iran. \"Obviously, if Iran has information that will be of interest to us, and if we have information that would be of interest to them, in pursuing our common purpose in defeating Daesh, then that's an appropriate exchange,\" she said, using an alternative name for ISIS. But Andrew Wilkie, an independent Australian member of parliament, criticized the plan. \"The announcement by the Foreign Minister that Australia is entering into a security arrangement with the regime in Tehran really should send shudders down the spine of every Australian,\" he said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"When you start dancing with the devil in a place like Tehran, then we run the risk of becoming almost as bad as those who we dance with,\" Wilkie told reporters.", "Chelsea crowned Premier League Champions, Bournemouth promoted and Tranmere Rovers relegated It's been a remarkable end to the English football season with Chelsea winning the Barclays Premier League and securing their spot in the Champions League. Meanwhile, Bournemouth was promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history, and Watford made their first return to the top flight since 2007. In other significant events, Bristol City was crowned the League One champions with two games to play, while Burton Albion was promoted from League Two along with Shrewsbury.

Sadly, this was a battle that he would not win, as the coroner records a verdict of misadventure in the tragic death of the decorated veteran. The soldier, whose identity has not been disclosed, fought valiantly on behalf of his country during the First Gulf War, Bosnia, and Northern Ireland. For over a decade, he put his life on the line in the service of his fellow citizens, representing the finest values and traditions of the military. However, returning home after 11 years in the Army, the former serviceman found himself lost in a world that had changed dramatically during his time away. The soldier's family has revealed the extent of his difficulties in adapting to civilian life, sharing that their loved one had previously taken an overdose of medication and confessed to attempting to take his own life. Despite the clearly apparent challenges he faced in transitioning back into society after so many years spent in the lethal crucible of war, the soldier nobly tried to overcome his personal demons and find some sense of normalcy in a new life. Ultimately, it was a battle he could not win. The official verdict, as recorded by the coroner, indicates that the soldier's death was the result of misadventure. Although this term may not capture the full scope of the tragedy that has befallen the family and friends of this dedicated serviceman, it speaks to the universal truth that the battles faced by soldiers do not always end when they return from the field. In his analysis of the case, the presiding coroner has expressed profound admiration and appreciation for the bravery displayed by the soldier throughout his life, both on the battlefield and in his personal struggles. As we pay our final respects to this fallen hero, it is important to remember that the support provided to veterans is a vital lifeline that can make a tangible difference in the lives of those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom and safety. May the tragic loss of this respected soldier serve as a reminder to us all of the immense responsibility we bear in ensuring that those who return from the field are given every opportunity to thrive in the world they have fought to protect.", "Person1: That's wonderful! Passion and interest in the subject are always important. Can you tell us about your musical background and experience? Person2: Of course! I started playing piano at the age of six and later picked up the guitar as well. I was part of my high school's orchestra and continued to play in various bands and ensembles throughout college. I also have experience teaching private music lessons for piano and guitar to students of varying ages and skill levels. Person1: That's an impressive background. How do you adapt your teaching style to accommodate different learning styles and needs of your students? Person2: I believe in a personalized approach to teaching music. I make sure to assess the individual needs and goals of each student, and then I tailor my lesson plans accordingly. For instance, I would focus more on rhythm and ear training for a student who struggles with keeping time, or introduce different genres and styles for someone who wants to explore beyond classical music. I also encourage my students to set their own goals and help them track their progress over time. Person1: That sounds like a very effective approach. In your opinion, what are some important qualities a music teacher should have? Person2: I think a good music teacher should be patient, empathetic, and adaptable. Patience is essential when working with students who may struggle or need extra time to grasp a concept. Empathy allows a teacher to understand the student's frustrations and challenges, and to provide encouragement and support when needed. Adaptability allows the teacher to adjust their teaching methods based on the student's individual learning styles and needs, ensuring that the lessons are engaging and effective. Person1: Those are excellent qualities. One last question: how would you handle a situation where a student is consistently not practicing or not showing progress? Person2: I would first try to have an open and honest conversation with the student to understand the root cause of the issue. It could be due to lack of time, motivation, or other personal challenges. Once I understand the reason, I would work with the student to come up with a plan to address the issue, whether that's developing a more realistic practice schedule, setting smaller and more achievable goals, or exploring alternative ways to reignite their passion for music. I also believe in maintaining close communication with parents or guardians to ensure they're aware and involved in helping the student stay on track. Person1: Thank you for sharing your insights. We appreciate your passion and dedication to teaching music, and we'll be in touch soon to discuss the next steps.", "Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids.

Silencing of FoxO-1 enhances VCAM-1 expression in both WT and Gas6 ECs. Inhibition of Akt or FoxO-1 phosphorylation prevents VCAM-1 expression in WT ECs. These data show that Gas6 induces FoxO-1 phosphorylation, leading to derepression of VCAM-1 expression. BM-MC-EC adhesion is increased by thrombin in WT ECs. BM-MC-EC adhesion is further increased when FoxO-1 is silenced, but decreased when FoxO-1 phosphorylation is inhibited. These results demonstrate that the Gas6-FoxO-1 signaling axis plays an important role in VCAM-1 expression in the context of VTE by promoting BM-MC-EC adhesion.", "Person1: Well, everyone has different tastes and preferences, but I feel like sometimes you're not even giving it a chance.

Most of the people I interacted with were my business contacts, but I also met some locals who gave me helpful tips and recommendations. Person1: That's nice.

This is because serum creatinine is not always a sensitive marker of kidney function, especially in the early stages of renal dysfunction. Patients with PVD are at risk of developing kidney problems due to their compromised blood flow and pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, which can both damage the kidneys. In such cases, more sensitive tests may be used to detect renal impairment, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or cystatin C levels. It is essential for clinicians to be aware of this possibility and monitor kidney function in patients with PVD closely using appropriate tools.", "Person1: I understand, moving can be expensive. Is there something specific you don't like about your current place? Person2: Well, the neighborhood isn't as safe as we'd like it to be, and our apartment is starting to feel a bit cramped since our family has been growing. Person1: That's definitely a good reason to move. Have you considered looking for more affordable options, such as smaller towns or rural areas? Person2: We have, but we both work in the city, so we need to find a balance between affordability and commute time. Person1: That can be tough. But it's good that you're at least considering your options. Hopefully, something will work out soon. Person2: Thank you, I appreciate your support.

But there's something we never knew about Bobby Drake, aka Iceman of the X-Men. Wednesday's issue of \"All-New X-Men\" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. \"There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,\" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. \"The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told.\" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the \"All-New X-Men\" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women \"hot,\" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the \"X-Men\" films, as well as the 1981 animated series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.\" The \"X-Men\" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well. Bendis further shared his thoughts on Twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on Tuesday: \"i swear on my dogs, i wanted the issue to come out and just be. no press. no sensational headlines. no leaks. oh, well...\"", "Person1: Oh wow, it looks fantastic!

Sagna's acrimonious departure from Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of last season left many Gunners fans dismayed at a perceived lack of loyalty from the defender. The France international has played only 16 times for City this season in an underwhelming campaign both for him and the Premier League holders, who are languishing in fourth.

Sangna (right) has only made 16 appearances and City are fourth in the Premier League, with Arsenal second .

But the 32-year-old Sagna says if he was faced with the decision again, he would make the same choice. 'I see a lot of comments from fans saying I should have stayed at Arsenal but if I had to do it again, if I had to come back and sign for City, I would have done it again,' Sagna told the Manchester Evening News. 'I'm happy because I came to the champions.' Sagna departed the Emirates on the back of an FA Cup triumph but arrived at City with the club having won the Premier League. A year later, Arsenal are gearing up to defend their trophy against Aston Villa in the final at Wembley but City's Premier League title will almost certainly be claimed by Chelsea.

Power's wife, a delivery driver, had been ticketed just a week earlier for illegally parking in the same spot. Mr. Power decided to take photographs of the police vehicles after witnessing the double standards between his wife's treatment and that of the police officers, who parked in the restricted area with apparent impunity. However, his actions soon drew unwanted attention from law enforcement. On his way home, Mr. Power was pulled over by police officers, who immediately began questioning him under the anti-terror laws, a measure typically reserved for individuals suspected of having connections to terrorism. According to Mr. Power, the officers demanded he delete the incriminating photos, but Power held his ground and refused to comply. The incident has raised several questions about the enforcement of traffic laws and the measures taken by police when dealing with civilians who question their actions. Critics argue that the use of anti-terror legislation against Mr. Power was unjustified and amounts to an abuse of power by the police. In response to the controversy, a police spokesperson stated that the officers involved were following standard procedure, asserting that a thorough investigation would be conducted into the events surrounding Mr. Power's detention. As the investigation continues, many are left asking whether the police response to a simple traffic dispute was truly warranted or if it signifies a larger issue of authority overreach. It remains to be seen if Mr. Power's defiance will lead to any reform in the way the law is enforced, but his actions have undoubtedly drawn attention to the broader issue of accountability amongst law enforcement officers.", "I have to admit, that out of the many many thriller movies i have seen, this has to be one of the worst. I was shocked to discover that this piece of work had a 1.5 mil budget. When it started, i thought that the opening sequence was pretty good, fairly standard for this kind of film, but pretty good anyway. But as the film progressed i began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing, each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason for this could have been that by now the film had already bored me to tears, nothing was happening other than endless accusations peppered with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fit of bad temper.

The 29-year-old is out of contract this summer and has yet to make a final decision regarding his future at Etihad Stadium. It is believed that Liverpool, Arsenal, and Everton are all keen on signing Milner to bolster their squads. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is said to have positioned Milner at the top of his wish list, seeking the English midfielder as a potential replacement for Steven Gerrard. The former England and Liverpool captain is set to leave for Major League Soccer in the United States in the coming months, leaving a significant void in the Reds' squad. While Rodgers looks for someone to fill Gerrard's shoes, Arsenal and Everton are also rumoured to have expressed interest in acquiring Milner. The England international's versatility, experience, and work ethic make him a desirable asset for any club in the English top flight. Despite the growing speculation surrounding his imminent future, Milner remains focused on his role at Manchester City. The midfielder has been vital in helping the team reach the top four in the Premier League and will now shift his focus to the upcoming UEFA Champions League knockout stage tie against Barcelona. With several options to weigh up and consider, it is expected Milner will take his time before making a final decision regarding his destination for the 201516 season.

Wolbachia is an intracellular bacterium that manipulates the reproduction of its host to increase its own transmission. The presence of Wolbachia in mosquitoes can lead to a variety of changes in gene expression, including alterations in DNA methylation patterns, which can have a dramatic impact on the biology of the host mosquito, Aedes aegypti. A study published in 2020 by Rago et al. explored the impact of the wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia on the cytosine methylation patterns in Aedes aegypti. The researchers found that there were significant differences in methylation between Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquitoes. Many genes that were differentially methylated were associated with various biological functions, such as reproduction, metabolism, and immune responses. This disruption of the host's methylation patterns could have important implications for understanding the complex interactions between Wolbachia and its mosquito host, as well as for the development of new strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases.", "Person1: That sounds like a fantastic event!

Bobby \"Iceman\" Drake, a founding member of the X-Men who has been part of Marvel Comics for more than 50 years, was revealed to be gay in \"All-New X-Men\" No. 40. The issue, written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by Mahmud Asrar, sees the psychic superheroine Jean Grey discovering Drake's sexuality during a heated conversation. In previous issues of the long-running comic series, Drake has had multiple relationships with women. However, recent comics have hinted at the possibility of Drake coming to terms with his sexuality. The decision to have a major superhero character come out as gay is a milestone in comic book history and signals that Marvel is making strides toward inclusivity and representation in their stories. As a founding member of one of the most well-known superhero teams in the world, Iceman's sexuality will be significant in continuing Marvel's legacy of embracing diversity in their characters. This revelation comes at a time when comic book creators are increasingly using their platforms and characters to provide a more diverse and inclusive world for their audiences, reflecting the changes seen in society today. With superhero stories dominating both print and film media, it's essential that superheroes represent a wide range of groups and identities. \"The world outside your window was always our mission statement,\" says Axel Alonso, the Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics. \"Our characters should reflect the world our readers live in, in all its diversity.\" In response to Iceman's coming out, GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, released a statement commending Marvel for taking a stand for inclusion. \"Marvel should be commended for pushing boundaries and ensuring that characters reflect the diverse world we live in,\" the statement read. \"The inclusion of a major character like Iceman sends a powerful message to fans and the industry about the importance of diversity and representation.\" Iceman is not the first gay character in the Marvel Comics universe, as the company has introduced other LGBTQ characters over the years, including Northstar and Wiccan. However, he is one of the most prominent, having been a key member of the X-Men since the team debuted in 1963. Marvel's willingness to explore diverse characters not only reflects societal changes but also encourages other comic creators to step up and make their worlds even more inclusive. Fans of the comic book series can look forward to seeing how Marvel will continue to develop Iceman's storyline in future issues.", "Person1: Are you going to the demonstration to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons tomorrow, Cleo?

Heterotopic ossification (HO) presents a substantial barrier to rehabilitation of patients who have incurred severe trauma. However, surgical excision of HO is fraught with complications, including the development of recurrent ectopic bone. In this study, a model of recurrent HO similar to that seen in secondary procedures was validated, demonstrating that similar signaling mechanisms and mesenchymal cell populations responsible for initial HO are present within the recurrent HO lesion. These findings indicate that recurrent HO is not simply an extension of unresected bone but rather represents new heterotopic bone lesions for which prophylactic measures are likely required.", "Doha, Qatar - A magnificent, glittering Goldfinch piano, adorned with half a million crystals, each meticulously applied by hand, has been crafted for a Sheikh in Doha, Qatar.

A study by Nguyen et al. (2018) showed that Frankia strains have a reduced repertoire of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), particularly in those strains capable of forming a nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationship with their host plants. The low capacity to degrade cell walls might be an adaptation to maintain the structural integrity of the host plant's cells during a symbiotic association, allowing the bacteria to form nodules and fix nitrogen effectively. However, the secretomes of different Frankia strains may vary significantly, and more research is needed to confirm these findings across all strains and different types of symbiotic relationships.", "Surging disappointments have emerged for Bayern Munich, following their most recent games. They have encountered an unfortunate series of matches, marking only one goal in their last three. This dry spell created a pinching sense of frustration following their near-victory against Bayer Leverkusen in the German Cup, ending in penalties. The renowned football manager and former professional football player, Pep Guardiola, has weighed in on the situation. In his opinion, the notable absence of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery is the missing key to Bayern Munich's recent struggle. The dedication, precision, and teamwork of these premier players are difficult to replicate without them present. Indeed, the recent goal drought has been an anomaly for the Bundesliga giants and should not detract from a strong season overall. With key figures like Robben and Ribery returning and the continued guidance of Guardiola, the team can learn from these losses and come back stronger and hungrier for their next matches. Bayern Munich remains a force to be reckoned with even amidst a temporary stumble.", "I thought this was a beautiful movie- very brave.

The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, though..it took awhile to feel for the characters-the husband could have been more abusive-he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him-it didn't really fit. The affair btwn. the best friend and husband seemed random..the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left (to live..) so when the infidelity was revealed, I didn't feel as much sympathy for the character-more like relief! the ending was so great- the lines btwn. her and the husband, and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant!", "I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. His latest film, \"The Intricacies of Life,\" showcases the director's unique and thought-provoking approach to storytelling. Haneke beautifully intertwines various character arcs, creating an undeniable tapestry of emotion. The visuals are nothing short of stunning, with each shot being meticulously crafted to make every frame feel like a work of art. The performances are exceptional, with the lead actors displaying a range of emotions that are captivating, raw, and genuine. They both execute their roles with such depth and sensitivity that the audience cannot help but be swept away by their stories. The supporting cast is equally impressive, adding depth and nuance to an already rich narrative. Haneke's storytelling shines brightest when tackling heavy themes, such as love, loss, and the human desire for connection. In \"The Intricacies of Life,\" these themes are explored with intelligence and empathy, never shying away from the darker aspects of the human experience. The story's multifaceted nature and layered characters provide ample opportunities for deep reflection and meaningful discourse long after the credits roll. The pacing of the film is slow and deliberate, which may not be to every viewer's taste. However, it allows the audience time to absorb the beauty of the visuals and the power of the story, making for a more immersive cinematic experience. Haneke's choice to use minimal dialogue and allow the scenes to unfold with a sense of realism is incredibly effective in building emotional tension and drawing the viewer further into the story. In conclusion, \"The Intricacies of Life\" is a hauntingly beautiful and thought-provoking film that solidifies Haneke's status as a master filmmaker. The movie may not be for everyone, but those who appreciate nuanced character studies and masterful visual storytelling should not miss this powerful cinematic experience.", "Kaitlyn Granado, a 24-year-old woman, was arrested for the second time amid claims of her involvement in sexual relationships with underage boys.

Following their investigation, the officers arrested Granado again on charges of having sex with the second boy in her car. At present, Granado is being held in custody, awaiting trial on both cases. The incidents have sparked a heated debate surrounding the issue of relationships between adults and minors. Under current law, engaging in a relationship with someone below the age of consent is a criminal offense, one that can lead to severe legal consequences for the adult involved. Authorities are urging families to remain vigilant and have open dialogue with their children regarding appropriate relationships and consent. They also encourage victims of sexual abuse or inappropriate conduct to come forward, ensuring that their families and the authorities will support them throughout the investigative process. As for Granado, her future remains uncertain. Depending on the outcome of her trial, she could face a lengthy prison sentence and may be required to register as a sex offender. The case also serves as a cautionary tale for individuals who engage in illicit relationships with minors, showing that the law will take action to protect their young and vulnerable victims.", "Chelsea Boss Mourinho Reveals Tactical Information from Hotel Doorman Before the Chelsea and Manchester United match at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had devised a plan to deal with Man United midfielder Marouane Fellaini. However, a hotel doorman told him that Fellaini would not be playing. It appears that the doorman had seen someone he believed was Fellaini collecting tickets from Chelsea forward Eden Hazard. A Google Images search revealed the mystery man to be Fellaini's twin brother. Even with the mix-up, Chelsea managed to counter Fellaini throughout the match, thanks to strong play from Kurt Zouma.", "Person1: Hello, there. What can we do for you today?

CAD systems have been developed to assist the identification of potentially suspicious areas on mammograms. These systems are designed to serve as a \"second pair of eyes\" when a radiologist interprets mammograms for signs of breast cancer. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals with a disease, while specificity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals without the disease. Studies have shown that the use of CAD can increase the sensitivity of screening mammography. This means that with CAD assistance, radiologists are more likely to detect true positives (actual cases of breast cancer). However, the impact of CAD on specificity has been mixed, with some studies showing a decrease in specificity, which may lead to an increase in false-positive results (identifying someone as having breast cancer when they do not). The overall effect of CAD on sensitivity and specificity may vary based on factors such as the quality of the CAD system, the clinical setting, and the experience of the radiologist using the system. Some studies also suggest that the benefit of CAD may be more pronounced for less experienced radiologists, while more experienced radiologists may not see as much improvement in sensitivity or specificity.", "This is first of all a good, exciting story, with well developed characters. \"The Adventure's Pledge\" captivates its audience from the very first scene, where we are thrust into a thrilling escapade filled with mystery, action, and heart.

I'm calling in regard to your recent inquiry about our products. How may I assist you today? Person2: Hello Taylor. I was looking into the new MacBook Pro and I had a few questions about its specifications and pricing. Can you help me with that? Person1: Of course, I'd be happy to help. The new MacBook Pro comes in two display sizes, 14-inch and 16-inch. Both models have the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, offering exceptional performance and power efficiency.

The M1 Pro chip is a step up from the standard M1 chip, offering 10-core CPU performance and up to a 16-core GPU, along with support for more memory and SSD storage. On the other hand, the M1 Max chip is the most powerful, featuring a 10-core CPU and up to a 32-core GPU. It also supports more memory and storage than the M1 Pro. Both chips provide amazing performance for tasks such as video editing, 3D rendering, and programming, but the M1 Max chip will give you the best performance for the most demanding workloads. Person2: That's very informative, thank you. In terms of memory and storage, what are the options available? Person1: For both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, you can configure the memory up to 64GB with the M1 Pro chip or up to an enormous 128GB with the M1 Max chip.

Smoking: Tobacco smoke contains several harmful chemicals that increase the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Smoking contributes to atherosclerosis, which is the build-up of plaque in the arteries that can eventually lead to blood clots and blockages. This can cause heart attacks and other long-term complications. 2. Obesity: Obesity increases the risk of various cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. These are risk factors that contribute to heart disease. Obesity may cause the body to produce more insulin, leading to insulin resistance in some cases. 3. Body fat distribution: Certain fat distributions, particularly when it starts accumulating around the abdomen, have been associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This is known as central obesity, where the waist circumference is high, indicating a build-up of visceral fat around the organs. Each of these factors independently can contribute to insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors, but when combined, they significantly increase the overall risk. Leading a healthy lifestyle by quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in regular physical activity can help decrease insulin resistance and lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.", "U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Julian McDonald of Columbus, Ohio, has adopted a four-year-old dog named Layka who served alongside him in Afghanistan and is credited with saving his life. The decision to adopt Layka comes as a testament to the bond they forged during their deployment. In 2012, Layka, a military working dog, was serving as the only canine member of her team in Afghanistan. During a mission, the dog was gravely injured but continued to protect her fellow soldiers, including McDonald. Despite her injuries, Layka completed the mission with her team, and her wounds were treated upon her return to safe territory. \"She was the sole reason why I was living and breathing and able to come home to my son and wife,\" said McDonald of his four-legged partner. \"I owe her everything, there's a bond between us that nobody will understand and nobody can break.\" The Columbus native and his family have welcomed Layka into their home with open arms, and the dog has become a beloved member of their household. McDonald is candid about the challenges of adopting a military dog, as these animals are trained and conditioned to cope with demanding missions and the stresses of combat. However, he believes the love and support he and his family provide for the valiant canine will help her transition into civilian life. \"Layka is adapting to her new life and surroundings well, and she's bringing joy to our family,\" McDonald said. \"She's our hero, and we will never forget the sacrifices she made to save our lives.\" The bond between military working dogs and their handlers is well-documented, as they serve together on the front lines in some of the most dangerous and hostile environments in the world. These dogs are specifically trained to detect explosives, find human remains, and conduct search-and-rescue missions, often putting their own lives at risk to protect those of their human counterparts. In recent years, there has been a push to ensure these dogs are given the opportunity to retire with dignity and be placed in loving homes. This has led to an increase in awareness about the importance of adopting military working dogs, as well as providing support for their continued care and rehabilitation after they retire from service.", "Watch as this brazen thief allegedly steals a donation box ahead of ANZAC Day from an RSL club.

The woman, who is donning a black-and-white striped top and a black vest, could be seen wandering her eyes around the room but walks away when a man strolls past with his blazer. She takes her reading glasses off and appears to clean them as she casually sits down on a seat before quickly pulling her black vest off. Watch as this brazen thief allegedly steals a donation box ahead of ANZAC Day at an RSL club in Melbourne . The empty room prompted the woman to make her way towards the desk before bringing her vest over the box and then casually walking out the glass entrance door.

Don't waste your time - there are many much better movies out there. Resurrection starts out OK but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My interest level fell off steadily. By the end of the movie I was just glad it was finally over. The characters never fully developed. The cinematography is muddy and the quick change POV rotations - while impressive in 1999 perhaps, presently merely serve to label the movie as attempting to substitute gee whiz flash for plot and character substance. The film shooting gimmicks serve some purpose (convey tension and anxiety) but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive.

A disappointment.", "I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. For example, I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (andor BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). I mean Ds is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something \"freakish\" or pathological; it isn't. In general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.So, for me, I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in Ds relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).", "Person1: Hi, Ann, welcome back.

Frankly, after watching \"Virtual Showdown,\" this question may remain unanswered, as director James Collin has cleverly blended the two genres, presenting a thrilling cinematic adventure that gamers and movie buffs alike would enjoy. The film revolves around protagonist, Alex Thompson, played convincingly by Aidan Turner, who must navigate the high-stakes world of a virtual reality game in order to save his sister from an enigmatic and dangerous game master. The film's immersive atmosphere is achieved through stunning visual effects and immersive background scores. It's worth noting that the ensemble cast does a stellar job in their respective roles, as the line between reality and virtual world blurs consistently in this action-packed thriller. Lily Collins plays the fierce and resourceful navigator for our protagonist, adding depth and complexity to the story. Though heavily reliant on CGI, \"Virtual Showdown\" does not falter in its attention towards storytelling and character development. This balance ensures that the audience remains engaged, anticipating the protagonist's next move while also rooting for Alex's personal growth. Despite borrowing elements from popular gaming tropes, the film provides some unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Ultimately, one cannot deny the appeal of \"Virtual Showdown\" to a wide spectrum of audiences. The film succeeds in merging the best of both gaming and film genres, offering a unique and exhilarating cinematic experience.", "All those who are into the PC culture are aghast at the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideation andor religious intolerance.Those who don't care about this, but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here.Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public, as evidenced in comments here.What is an interesting premise, which isn't original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film, yet done with gusto. What the crew and actors lacked in sensibility, professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display.It isn't nearly as bad as many here think, and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans. However, it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout, and is close to on par with a Corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work, or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman.

The incident took place on Wednesday, and the footage was posted on Facebook in an attempt to track down the suspect. The CCTV footage captures the woman casually entering the venue, then proceeding to bring her vest over the box containing the ANZAC badges, specifically designed to commemorate the sacrifices of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. These badges are typically sold on the lead-up to ANZAC Day, with all proceeds going towards supporting veterans and their families. The heartless act has sparked outrage in the community as the donations are intended to honor and support the veteran community, including those who have bravely fought for their country. Caulfield RSL management posted the video on their Facebook page, urging the public to identify the woman and bring her to justice. The video has since garnered thousands of views and angry reactions from users who are appalled by the theft.

Don't let the Disney label lead you to think this is dumbed-down or only for kids it has a lot to offer to all ages, whether you like golf or not. One of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting. And speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on TV, this is no small feat.The first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds, enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through. Sure, you root for Ouimet's character all along, but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right. The background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs, since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses.The computer effects are flashy, but they do help the story more often than not. The directing has all sorts of clever golf shots, and the period costumes and sets are really top notch.There are a few small quibbles many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold, but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn.Shia LaBoeuf playing Francis Ouimet is, as usual, callow and sympathetic. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, playing Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad, eyes and minor changes of expression say so much.Ouimet's caddy Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he is in. After you see the film, Google to find the actual photograph of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament, to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was.", "Person1: That's great.

I also remember the chess player and the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home, something really curious. The woman acting as the lawyer is, to me, one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen. But I must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously. The character who plays the lead theater actor is really endearing, especially when he's annoyed by the new actor, the one in the purple t-shirt. Their dynamic adds a layer of humor and charm to the film. The scene where the bearded actor - who belongs to another company - directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing, as it often happens with this movie. For example, when the characters drink tea, they just make you want to have a cup with them. The cinematography is stunning and visually pleasing, with well-framed shots that delight the eye. The director demonstrates a strong understanding of the art of filmmaking and a unique ability to tell stories through powerful images. Despite the inconsistencies in the plot, the movie holds the audience's attention through its captivating characters and the beautiful visuals. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, adding depth to the story and enhancing the overall experience. In conclusion, this film may not be perfect in terms of plot and narrative, but it is a beautiful and enjoyable watch for those who appreciate its quirky characters, stunning visuals, and immersive atmosphere.

The film expertly intertwines humor and emotion as it follows Rains' character, who must navigate the hardships of single parenthood in a time when societal expectations were far different than today. The four daughters, played by a talented ensemble cast, each bring their unique personalities and challenges to the story. Throughout the movie, we witness the sisters growing and evolving, both individually and as a family unit. The chemistry between the actors is undeniable and truly drives the emotional depth of the film, creating an authentic and relatable family dynamic. Director Jane Smith succeeds in bringing light to the often-overlooked struggles of single parents, particularly fathers, with grace and sensitivity. The cinematography is subtle yet powerful, capturing the essence of the father-daughter relationships and the beautiful landscape that surrounds them.

Hospital quality management strategies aim to improve the overall efficiency, safety, and effectiveness of healthcare services. These may include improving clinical outcomes, reducing errors, enhancing patient satisfaction, and ensuring the provision of evidence-based care. Patient experience, on the other hand, refers to the individual experiences of patients during their hospital stay, including aspects such as communication, responsiveness, environment, and emotional support. It is influenced by various factors, including individual expectations, personal values, and past healthcare experiences. While hospital quality management strategies can lead to improved patient experiences in some cases, it is also possible to have high-quality care without necessarily resulting in excellent patient experience. Similarly, a positive patient experience does not always guarantee high-quality care.

Viscum triflorum is a hemi-parasitic plant, which means it partially relies on its host plant for water and nutrients. As a result, the host plant's metabolic profile can potentially impact the composition of secondary metabolites in Viscum triflorum. These metabolites, in turn, could influence the ACE inhibitory activity of the plant extracts. Limited studies have addressed this question directly. However, a 2017 study by Koffi-Nevry et al. Ethnobotany, phytochemistry, and traditional usages of Viscum triflorum (Loranthaceae) host-dependent populations in Cote d'Ivoire suggests that the traditional medicinal use of Viscum triflorum is significantly affected by the host plant from which it is harvested. Additionally, a 2015 study by Jagessar et al. A comparative study on the ACE inhibitory activity in the extracts of Viscum album subspecies in the various host plants found variations in the ACE inhibitory activity depending on the host plant. In conclusion, while there is some evidence suggesting that ACE inhibitory activity of Viscum triflorum could be host plant-dependent, further research is needed to confirm this claim and provide more information on the specific factors influencing its pharmacological properties.", "Person1: That's a great initiative, Tim! So, what were some of the changes you and your family made to live greener? Person2: One of the biggest changes we made was reducing our plastic usage. We started using cloth bags for grocery shopping, replaced plastic straws with reusable metal ones, and even started using a water filter at home to reduce the number of plastic water bottles we consumed. Person1: Those are some excellent steps towards reducing plastic waste. What else did you do to lead a more eco-friendly life? Person2: We also started composting our food waste to create nutrient-rich fertilizer for our garden. This not only reduces the amount of trash we generate, but it also helps to naturally nourish our plants. Additionally, we've been more conscious about saving energy by switching off lights and electronic devices when they're not in use. Person1: All of these small changes can add up to make a big difference! Have you inspired others to adopt similar practices? Person2: Yes, actually! I've talked about these changes with my friends, and some of them have started implementing these practices in their own lives as well.

Adi Viveash's side is now just one victory away from achieving the back-to-back European titles as they prepare to face Shakhtar Donetsk in the final match of the UEFA Youth League. The star of the night was Dominic Solanke, the 18-year-old Chelsea youth striker who scored two fantastic goals and showcased his immense talent in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Cobham Training Centre. The strong line-up of Chelsea players included Mason Mount, Kyle Scott, Jay Dasilva, and Dujon Sterling, who all contributed immensely to the victory. Chelsea controlled the game from the outset, with their first clear opportunity in the 12th minute when a shot from Solanke was saved by the goalkeeper, only for his follow-up attempt to balloon over the bar. However, it didn't take long for the young Englishman to find the net, as he broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute with a powerful header from a brilliant cross by Charlie Wakefield. Solanke notched his second goal just eight minutes later when he calmly rounded Roma goalkeeper Stefano Greco and cleared the ball into an open net. Further goals came from Fikayo Tomori in the 50th minute and Charlie Colkett in the 63rd which left Roma without any hope of coming back into the tie. Chelsea's manager, Adi Viveash, praised the team's performance: \"It was an outstanding display. We dominated the game from start to finish and didn't allow Roma much of a chance to get close to us. We knew we had the quality to go all the way in this competition, and today we showed it.\" Shakhtar Donetsk will be a tough opponent in the final, having reached the final stages of this competition last season too. Their semi-final victory over Anderlecht was impressive, coming back from 3-1 down to win 4-3, so Chelsea U19s have a challenging task ahead of them. However, with talented youngsters like Dominic Solanke leading the team, Chelsea fans have every reason to be optimistic about their chances of lifting the UEFA Youth League trophy for the second year running.", "Although the SFU grading system is considered the predominant grading system for HN, its application in clinical practice has been inconsistent. While this may be due to the grading system itself, it is possible that deficient training and confidence are the root causes. Our data supports this by demonstrating that most clinicians receive only casual training and accordingly, report low confidence in their knowledge and ability to grade HN. Therefore, we conclude that there exists a strong need to improve the teaching of the SFU grading system. e-Learning has been shown to be effective in teaching difficult topics and skills. We demonstrate that e-Learning with CEVL is effective in increasing both the confidence and accuracy of SFU grading of pediatric HN. Limitations of our study include a small sample size, low response rate, and discrepant participation. Furthermore, we did not assess the extent to which the CEVL module was used or include a control group learning through traditional means. Therefore, we were unable to evaluate the efficiency of learning or be certain that the improvements seen were derived exclusively from CEVL.", "Yes, deregulation of the phosphatase PP2A is a common event in breast cancer, and it has been observed to predict sensitivity to FTY720. FTY720, also known as Fingolimod, is an immunosuppressive drug used to treat multiple sclerosis and shows potential as a breast cancer therapy. Research has found that PP2A is often deregulated in breast cancer and its reactivation can lead to tumor suppression. FTY720 can reactivate PP2A signaling and has shown to have an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells. In multiple studies, breast cancer cells with deregulated PP2A are observed to be more sensitive to FTY720 treatment. Therefore, deregulation of PP2A can be considered a predictive factor for sensitivity to FTY720 in breast cancer therapy.", "A plane passenger got the shock of his life when he assaulted a man who was a former corrections officer. Chad Hurst of Salt Lake City, Utah, says he pulled the young man aside after their flight from Denver, Colorado had landed on Sunday, and had a word with him about the foul language he had been using on the plane. That is when the young man, who was carrying a skateboard, sucker punched Hurst. Scroll down for video . Good Samaritan: Chad Hurst (right in hat) spoke to a young man about his foul language during their flight when they landed in Salt Lake City on Sunday . Lashing out: The young man then sucker punched Hurst in the stomach (above) Hurst then calmly proceeded to grab the young man by the shoulder, bring him to the ground, put his hands behind his back and get on top of him until police arrived on the scene. CBS Denver reports the young man was then charged withassault and public intoxication. 'In a former life I was a corrections officer about 10 years ago and my training was to never punch back. It was to control the situation and to take the person down,' said Hurst. That is just what Hurst did too, with the entire incident lasting just a few seconds before the young man was on the ground. Taking him down: Hurst, a former corrections officer, then grabbed the young man (above) and took him down .

NGF is a well-known player in the development, survival, and function of neurons. Studies have shown that NGF can promote angiogenesis, or the formation of new blood vessels, and that it may be involved in the innervation of newly formed blood vessels. In the context of tumor-derived neovasculature, it is possible that NGF could facilitate the growth of perivascular nerves. A study published in 1998 by Cohen et al. investigated the role of NGF in the innervation of blood vessels in the mouse cornea. This study used an in vivo model in which they implanted a pellet containing NGF into the cornea of mice and observed its effects on the growth of blood vessels and nerves. They found that NGF promoted the formation of new blood vessels, known as neovasculature, and that there was a significant increase in the innervation of these new vessels by perivascular nerves when compared to a control group. This research supports the idea that NGF could facilitate the innervation of perivascular nerves in tumor-derived neovasculature in the mouse cornea. However, more research would be needed to confirm the role of NGF in specifically tumor-derived neovasculature, as opposed to neovasculature that is formed in response to other stimuli. Additionally, it is important to consider the many complex factors involved in the formation of blood vessels and nerves and to investigate the roles of other growth factors and signaling pathways in this process.", "There is some evidence to suggest that resistance to Echinostoma caproni secondary infections in mice may be related to ileal protein production, particularly in the production of specific immune proteins. Echinostoma caproni is a parasitic trematode that infects the small intestines of rodents, causing echinostomiasis. Mice can develop resistance to secondary infections due to the immune response generated during the primary infection. This resistance is often attributed to the production of specific immune proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and antibodies involved in the host's defense against parasites. One study (Cortes et al., 2017) showed that during the primary infection of mice with Echinostoma caproni, there was an upregulation of several cytokines and immune mediators, which led to a reduction of worm burden in secondary infections. In addition, other research has demonstrated that production of certain cytokines, like interleukin-13 (IL-13), can cause an increased mucus production, smooth muscle contraction, and increased epithelial cell turnover, which may contribute to the expulsion of parasites from the gut (Dawson et al., 2005). Overall, while there is evidence to suggest a relationship between ileal protein production and resistance to Echinostoma caproni secondary infections in mice, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this resistance.

Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase, really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times. His co-star in here, Farley Granger, is okay but is no match for Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent man gets in trouble, etc. Unlike a lot of his other films, I thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots. Being an ex-tennis player, I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies. Hitchcock's real-life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. She didn't just get the job because of her dad; she can act. Also of note: the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story.

It's a captivating cinematic masterpiece that leaves viewers mesmerized and thirsty for more.", "The origin of life is a highly debated topic with various theories and hypotheses, one of which is the idea of a spatially localized stochastic transition. This concept suggests that the formation of life emerged in a particular location, essentially by chance, as a result of specific environmental conditions and molecular interactions. In this view, life's emergence is seen as a stochastic event, meaning that it is the outcome of random processes and the probability of it occurring could be very low. This perspective on the origin of life does not necessarily point to a single, universally agreed-upon mechanism but recognizes that particular spatial conditions and molecular interactions might have played a significant role in the development of living organisms. However, there are alternative theories for the origin of life, such as those involving extraterrestrial delivery of organic materials, deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments, or other non-stochastic chemical processes. The complex nature of life and the extensive timescales that preceded it makes this question challenging to answer definitively. Nonetheless, the idea of a spatially localized stochastic transition is one possible hypothesis for the emergence of life on Earth.", "(CNN) Jason Rezaian has sat in jail in Iran for nearly nine months. The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran was arrested in July on unspecified allegations. It took more than four months for a judge to hear charges against him. They remained publicly undisclosed until last week. The Iranian-American will be tried soon on espionage, Tehran's chief justice said. He is accused of economic spying, the Post reported, citing Iranian state media. The Washington Post did not mince words on the allegation. \"Any charges of that sort would be absurd, the product of fertile and twisted imaginations,\" the paper said in a statement. The State Department also reacted with term \"absurd\" after hearing of reports in Iran's press about the charges. \"If the reports are true, these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed and Jason should be immediately freed so that he can return to his family,\" the State Department official said. Since officers picked up Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, on July 22 at their home, the Post, the State Department and Rezaian's family have protested and called for his release. Salehi was released on bail in October. Rezaian was denied bail. And for months, he was denied access to proper legal representation, his family has said. Boxing great Muhammad Ali, also an American Muslim, appealed to Tehran last month to give Rezaian full access to legal representation and free him on bail. \"To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work,\" Ali said in a religiously worded statement. The journalist has also not been allowed to see visitors aside from his wife and has endured long interrogations, family members have said. In December, after a 10-hour hearing, Rezaian signed a paper to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him, the Post reported. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. He said, \"Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms.\" More on detained Americans .

While the storyline strays quite far from the original H.G. Wells novel, the film still manages to convey the distressing, chaotic mood of a full-blown alien invasion. Cruise delivers a strong performance as Ray Ferrier, a troubled, blue-collar father struggling to protect his two children through the chaos. Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin, who play Ferrier's children, also showcase some great acting chops and their performances are a cut above the usual portrayal of children in crisis. However, the film's great downfall lies in the veering away from the source material, which results in key characters and events being changed or omitted entirely. Furthermore, it feels like Spielberg is sidetracked by the big-budget Hollywood action tropes, resulting in an overreliance on jump scares and CGI spectacles rather than the suspenseful psychological horror of the original story. The film does make an attempt at exploring some deeper themes, such as the human ability to survive and the bonds of family, but these themes often get lost amidst the whirlwind of destruction. Shamefully, the ending seems rushed and counterintuitive, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment. In conclusion, this version of \"War of the Worlds\" is an entertaining, high-octane roller coaster ride that is visually stunning and bolstered by the strong acting prowess of Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and Justin Chatwin. Yet, the movie falls short of its potential in terms of storyline and thematic development. It is worth watching for its visual thrills, but those who seek a faithful adaptation of H.G.

A phenomenological study aims to understand the lived experiences of individuals with chronic pain and how it impacts their lives. This kind of study investigates the individual's unique perceptions, beliefs, and interpretations of their chronic pain and its effects on their daily life. Some common themes emerging from such studies are as follows: 1. Physical impact: Chronic pain restricts physical activities, mobility, and performance of daily tasks. People may experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, and a decline in overall health. 2. Emotional impact: Chronic pain increases vulnerability to negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, frustration, and anger. These emotions can intensify the pain and affect the overall quality of life. 3. Cognitive impact: People with chronic pain may experience difficulties in concentration, decision-making, and memory. These cognitive changes can further aggravate the emotional and physical consequences of pain. 4. Social impact: Chronic pain can lead to social isolation, impacting relationships with family and friends. People may withdraw from social participation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety. 5. Spiritual or existential impact: Chronic pain can also lead to deep existential and spiritual questioning. Some people may struggle to find meaning and purpose in their lives, while others may experience renewed faith or spiritual growth. 6. Coping strategies: Individuals with chronic pain often rely on various coping strategies such as medication, alternative treatments, cognitive-behavioral strategies, or seeking support from friends and family. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary, and it is crucial to determine individual preferences and needs. In conclusion, a phenomenological study can help shed light on the complex and multifaceted ways in which chronic pain affects the whole person. Understanding these experiences can inform better treatment approaches and support for individuals living with chronic pain.", "Yemeni Houthi rebels announced on Friday that fighters will not withdraw from major cities, as stated by the leader of the Iran-aligned Islamist movement.

However, the Yemeni government, which is backed by a US-supported Saudi-led coalition, has already staged a partial withdrawal. In another development today, Brigadier General Tariq Saleh pledged his support to Yemen's ousted President. Tariq, nephew of the slain ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, emphasized in a statement released by his office that his fighters will focus on \"liberating the remaining cities under the control of Houthi militia.\" The move emphasizes the divisions within the country, as the exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his separatist rivals struggle for control over the Yemeni provinces as well as the capital Aden. The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people since 2015, many of them civilians, in an alarming humanitarian crisis in the Arab region's poorest country. The crisis intensified after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates led a coalition to overthrow the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who ousted the government-backed Hadi from Sana'a, Yemen's traditional capital. Iranian State TV has so far accused the Saudi-led coalition of numerous attacks on civilian targets such as markets and schools. The US, a key backer to the coalition, has been providing them with intelligence and logistical support but facing strong criticism by even its own officials. Despite the recent developments in peace talks, fighters remain on the strategic port city of Hudaydah, Yemen's fourth-largest city and a densely populated stronghold of the Houthi rebels. Al-Houthi also blamed the international community for \"holding back peace\" and failing to address the country's food crisis, energy, and water shortages faced by millions of Yemeni people today.", "It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. \"Giallo Fiasco\" had the potential to be a riveting murder mystery with all the classic elements of the giallo genre - suspense, stylish kills, and twists and turns. However, it falls short of expectations, feeling uninspired and riddled with cliches. The film's protagonist - a detective on the brink of retirement - is immediately recognized as a tired trope and Deodato fails to give him any depth or originality. The supporting characters are equally thin, making it nearly impossible to get invested in the story or care about who will survive until the closing credits. What is most shocking, however, is Deodato's mishandling of the bloodshed and gore that usually serves as the backbone of a giallo film. The kills lack any creativity or flair, resorting to cheap jumps scares and unconvincing special effects. It is as if Deodato's spark for innovation and artistic vision has been extinguished. The only redeeming aspect of \"Giallo Fiasco\" may be its vibrant color palette and visually striking shots, harking back to the golden age of giallo and Italian horror. Unfortunately, even those visuals are unable to save the film from utter mediocrity. \"Giallo Fiasco\" is an unfortunate letdown, a stain on the legacy of a once-acclaimed director. Deodato fans will be left with a bitter taste in their mouths, wondering where the genius behind classics like \"Cannibal Holocaust\" and \"The House on the Edge of the Park\" has gone. Save yourself the disappointment and watch a classic giallo instead.", "An enormous 400lb, 11ft-long alligator has been removed from a family's backyard pond in Beaumont, Texas, by Gary Saurage, the owner of the Gator Country wildlife park. Saurage, 45, responded to an emergency call from the family on Monday morning, where he proceeded to apprehend the giant reptile using only his bare hands. A photograph of the captivating capture, which shows Saurage looking directly into the eyes of the alligator, was later shared on Facebook. The giant alligator will now be housed at the Gator Country wildlife park, which allows visitors to observe these magnificent creatures up close. Saurage hopes that the alligator's presence will help to educate people about alligators and their importance within the native ecosystems. Despite their impressive size and predatory nature, alligators are generally shy creatures that avoid contact with humans. However, as their habitats have been reduced due to human encroachment, these animals have been forced to live closer to people, leading to an increased risk of encounters. In Texas, alligator populations have bounced back from near extinction in the 1960s to an estimated 500,000 today, thanks to habitat conservation efforts. However, as these numbers continue to rise and expand, so do the number of human-alligator interactions, compelling local authorities to provide guidelines on how to safely coexist with the reptiles. Overall, captures such as this shine a light on the importance of understanding and coexisting with alligators, as well as highlighting the dedication of wildlife experts like Gary Saurage to protect and conserve these incredible animals.", "The jury is rapidly nearing a verdict in Aaron Hernandez's murder trial after the defense team presented their entire case in just one day. Prosecution took two months and more than 100 pieces of evidence to accuse the former New England Patriots player of killing Odin Lloyd, who was shot six times in the chest and back on June 17, 2013. Defending his not guilty plea, Hernandez's lawyers called five witnesses to testify on Monday before resting at 3pm. Following tomorrow's closing statements, the jury will deliberate on their verdict. Scroll down for video . Nearing the end: Aaron Hernandez's defense team took just one day to deliver their case against prosecutors who spent two months producing 100 pieces of evidence. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. At the time of the killing, in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home, the tight end had a 40 million contract with the Patriots. The defense's first witness was Dr. David Greenblatt, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, who testified that the drug PCP can cause people to be suddenly violent, even days after smoking it. Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were seen smoking PCP a few days before the crime. Both men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later. Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg went after Greenblatt's testimony, showing surveillance video of Ortiz, Wallace and Hernandez from Hernandez's home before and immediately after the killing. In the videos, the men do not appear to be acting strangely. The former New England Patriots smiles during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court . The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday . 'This is essentially three minutes after the murder - you'd expect to see something lingering of PCP psychosis or intoxication,' Bomberg said, asking if Greenblatt could detect such behavior. 'You just can't tell,' Greenblatt replied. Testimony by two other witnesses related to DNA on a shell casing found inside a silver Nissan Altima that Hernandez rented, which prosecutors say he used to drive Lloyd to his death. When police found the shell casing in a trash bin at a rental car agency, it was stuck to chewed blue bubble gum that also was found in the Nissan. In testing, Hernandez's DNA was found on the shell casing. The defense has argued it got there from the bubble gum. Hernandez lawyer James Sultan said he planned to call just three witnesses before resting later Monday. The judge has said she expects closing arguments to be delivered on Tuesday or Wednesday.

So far, tolerance to stress has been credited to trehalose synthesis. The data presented in this work provided information on the underlying mechanism that prevents trehalose accumulation and corroborated the recent information that trehalose itself is not implicated in yeast stress tolerance. Second, it showed that D.bruxellensis responds differently to Saccharomyces cerevisiae to excess of sugar, which may explain its preference for respiration (oxidative metabolism) over fermentation (reductive metabolism) even at limited oxygen supply. These findings help to understand the drop on ethanol production in processes overtaken by this yeast.", "Person1: Yes. Can I help you? Person2: Yes.

Have a great day!", "Yes, the Mediterranean diet, without red wine, has been associated with beneficial changes in primary hemostasis. Primary hemostasis is the process by which blood platelets adhere to damaged blood vessels and form a plug to stop bleeding. Since the Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and fish, it has been linked to improved cardiovascular health and reduced inflammation, which can positively impact primary hemostasis. Several components of the Mediterranean diet, such as the high intake of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and the use of extra virgin olive oil, have been shown to have antithrombotic (anti-clotting) effects, which can improve primary hemostasis. Furthermore, the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants and polyphenols has been demonstrated to alter platelet function, inhibit platelet aggregation, and improve overall blood clotting. While moderate red wine consumption has been reported to have some cardiovascular benefits due to its content of polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol, it is important to note that these beneficial effects can also be obtained from other dietary sources of polyphenols, such as fruits, vegetables, and extra virgin olive oil, without the potential risks associated with alcohol consumption.", "The values of biochemical parameters such as kinetic rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, total concentrations of kinases and of phosphatases, determine the propensity of a cascade to favor or impede downstream or upstream signal transmission. We found that generally there is an opposition between parameter sets favoring forward and retro-signaling regimes. Therefore, on one hand our study supports the idea that in most cases, retroactive effects can be neglected when a cascade which is efficient in forward signaling, is perturbed by an external ligand inhibiting the activation at some tier of the cascade. This result is relevant for therapeutic methodologies based on kinase inhibition. On the other hand, our study highlights a less-known part of the parameter space where, although the forward signaling is inefficient, the cascade can interestingly act as a retro-signaling device.", "Our results underline a crucial role for Lrp1b in development. The expression in mice of truncated alleles of Lrp1b and Lrp4 with deletions of the transmembrane and intracellular domains leads to release of the extracellular domain into the extracellular space, which is sufficient to confer viability. In contrast, null mutations are embryonically (Lrp1b) or perinatally (Lrp4) lethal. These findings suggest that the extracellular domains of both proteins may function as a scavenger for signaling ligands or signal modulators in the extracellular space, thereby preserving signaling thresholds that are critical for embryonic development, as well as for the clear, but poorly understood role of LRP1b in cancer.", "Malaysia, Australia, and China have recently announced the potential next phase in their search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, stating that they feel \"cautiously optimistic\" that the plane will be found soon. The current priority search zone is expected to be completed in May, at which time the three countries will reassess their strategies for finding the aircraft. Speaking at a tripartite meeting, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack expressed hope that the aircraft would be found in the current search area in the southern Indian Ocean. However, he also emphasized the need for the three countries to plan for a potential new phase of the search. \"It is important we prepare for the next phase of the search to ensure the ongoing work is as effective as possible,\" McCormack said. He added that officials from the three countries would meet again in June to decide on the areas that should be searched next. The countries are currently focusing their efforts on the 120,000 square kilometer search area in the southern Indian Ocean, where the plane is believed to have crashed en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014, with 239 people aboard. The search for the plane has been the most expensive and complex in aviation history, costing more than 150 million to date. In previous searches, teams have identified several shipwrecks, but no evidence of the aircraft has been found. The potential new phase of the hunt comes years after the original search for the plane was suspended in January 2017, following a lack of new clues or information. In 2018, the search resumed with private company Ocean Infinity - who offered a \"no-find, no-fee\" deal - conducting the search on behalf of the Malaysian government. Since the disappearance of the flight, there have been several theories about what happened to the plane, ranging from a hijacking to a pilot murder-suicide to a possible fire onboard. However, none of these theories have been proven, and without any evidence found, the search remains open to speculation.", "A man has been charged after he allegedly held a womanhostage at knifepoint for more than seven hours in a central Melbourne restaurant.

Victoria Police arrested 35-year-old Abijath Desikan following the 7.5 hour siege at Riverside Quay . The siege came to an end just before 5.30am this morning when police entered the restaurant and tasered the man. The 27-year-old female employee held in the restaurant emerged with police shortly afterward. Police said the man was a 'disgruntled' former employee of the restaurant who allegedly entered a restaurant storeroom armed with a knife. Other restaurant staff members who saw the knife evacuated customers before calling police, ABC reported. Nearby areas were evacuated, and a police cordon was set up while specialist officers negotiated with the man. Last night, a police spokeswoman said the critical incident response team were on site negotiating with the man. 'The restaurant and surrounding areas have been evacuated and police are negotiating with the man,' the spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

However, this would depend upon the specific QTL region studied, the genetic markers used, and the statistical methods employed to analyze the data. Epistatic interactions refer to interactions between different genes that affect a particular trait, such as fatness or growth rate. Identifying these interactions is essential for understanding the genetic architecture underlying complex traits and for improving the effectiveness of genetic selection in animal breeding. In pigs, several QTLs affecting fatness traits have been identified on different chromosomes, including SSC2. Progeny testing of full-sibs IBD can help to further understand the genetic basis of these traits and identify epistatic interactions between the loci involved. By analyzing the inheritance patterns of genetic markers in a family-based approach, it is possible to identify which alleles are associated with variations in fatness traits and determine whether there are any significant interactions between the genes located in the QTL region. However, it is important to note that this approach alone may not be sufficient to decipher the full complexity of the genetic control of fatness traits in pigs. Complementary techniques, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression experiments, may also be required to further elucidate the underlying genetic architecture.", "The results taken together seem to imply that social marketing is likely to encounter difficulty in changing behavior because the subjective norm (what others think I should do) coupled with the lack of enforcement (verbal norms) play important roles in maintaining the unlawful behavior. Moreover, the perception that talking on the mobile phone while driving is acceptable behavior (injunctive norm) in conjunction with the purpose of the call create further challenges to social marketers. The results have implications on policy makers and enforcers. Law enforcers should do their job to prevent the wrong behavior in the first place. In addition, campaigns may be directed to convince the target audience about the false norms and use persuasive communication to emphasize the potential costs of maintaining the unlawful behavior.", "I like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce Hugo Weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best most capable actors around, but I could not get into this. I don't know if it's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not get my head around this film. Worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the point, I don't know. I realize that is probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I must say I bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. I will say that I can't usually appreciate costume designers very well, although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very much impressed with these. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I don't think they're supposed to be. I don't know I am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers, but I wouldn't go see ballet, or opera either so I don't know. If this is your kind of film then you will probably like it, but if it's not skip it because it is...well not for most of us.

Kieron Power's wife had previously been given a 110 ticket for stopping in the same place for 45 seconds behind a police car and van. A week after she received the ticket given out by a council CCTV 'spy car', he went back to gather evidence of police cars parked at the stop in Kingston upon Thames, South-West London. Delivery driver Kieron Power was pulled over and questioned under anti-terror laws after taking these pictures of police vehicles parked in a bus stop . Mr Power, 54, from Esher, Surrey, was on his way home after taking the photographs when a police car came up behind him with its blue lights flashing. He said: 'I didn't think much, because I wasn't doing anything wrong, but then all of a sudden another police car appeared in front of me in a pincer movement and I was forced to stop. 'They told me they were stopping me under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They said I'd been seen taking pictures of police cars, which I admitted. 'I told them why, but they still demanded my pictures be deleted. I refused, because I had done nothing wrong, and the officer spoke to his commander. Eventually I was allowed on my way - it seemed so heavy-handed. Mr Power, 54, was stopped in a pincer manoeuvre by a pair of police cars after he took photographs of two vehicles parked up in a bus stand - because his wife was given a 110 ticket for doing the same thing . 'I was annoyed that my wife had been given a ticket for briefly stopping somewhere the police always park, but I never dreamed I would be accused of being a terrorist.' Mr Power's wife has paid the ticket for parking behind the Bittoms centre in Kingston after an appeal on the grounds that police were blocking the 'bus stand' markings failed. A Kingston police spokesman said: 'The man was initially requested to delete the photos, however after the officer clarified the Metropolitan Police Service's approach towards photography of police officers and vehicles with his supervisors, he realised the man was allowed to keep them. 'The police vehicles parked on the bus stand are part of the Met's Safer Transport Command and have been given permission by the local authority to park there.' Mr Power said: 'I appreciate that police cars need to stop wherever they can for operational matters, but these vehicles are always there. It's one rule for them and one rule for us, I suppose.'", "On the cusp of being insufferable. Somehow I stayed just slightly interested, but was it because I truly wanted to know what the \"secret\" was (which, I should say, is pretty damned obvious) or because I hoped Scarlett Johansson would put on a more sexy outfit?

Stop this director before heshe (name is vague on gender) directs again!", "The movie starts off promisingly enough, the use of imagery and simple short clips convey the bigger story, which would normally need a considerably higher budget than the one here. However it did start to worry me as it continued, combined with another overly husky Max Payne type voice over the movie was starting to look not so good. I hoped it was just the introduction to the story.The story is what really caught me and took me to this movie. The idea that a research scientist has created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from other infection was an interesting scientific idea. Then that subjects who had the most bizarre disorders sought out the scientist and offered to be his human experiments made me think this could be one very good small movie. Yet the introduction hadn't gone well.There did seem to be a change of pace as the movie turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the movie, the test subjects. Although the acting wasn't superb, there seemed to be a lot of scope for character development throughout the movie, and the recordings were done quite well with a varied mix of characters. However these faded through the movie. They weren't used again after a few brief clips and I did feel that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development by reflecting back to them, however it wasn't to be.The imagery becomes increasingly disconnected from the story, often repeating to represent something that is still happening. This disconnection and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting commentary. It began reciting words one after the other. Short, meaningless sentences and reciting none too relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. If there was something to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looping,...you're getting the idea.Now this could have been to reflect the confusion and of the character, slowly becoming caught up in his own thoughts, rambling due to lack of food and water. What it actually did was to cause me to totally switch off to the voice and by the closing stages of the movie I found that I hadn't been listening to some of the ramblings.A number of times that an event occurs the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. There are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene, for instance a character sleeping fades to black, then fades back in on the character sleeping again. Look, we know the character is asleep, we know time has passed, please move on. Overall there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots to fill time.The acting was not bad, and the characters were okay, but not exploited and developed. When they were interacting there were some truly cringeworthy moments. For example when one of them asks if they are hungry the camera looks to each of them and returns to a group shot, they pause, look to each other, turn back to camera and say slowly \"No.\" It raised a snigger or two. Their dialogue was slow, glossy and either it was missing altogether or totally unnecessary, there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue hit spot on.However, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find unless you viewed them in isolation, and this is what it almost looks like has happened with this movie. The film has been looked at as a series of scenes and not as a complete story.Nowhere is this seen more than in the main storyline. The characters are infected with the virus that has been killing the animals, the one that was being engineered for them. We're told that it develops in stages to something dramatic, and so that is what we expect. What we get are the characters eating loads together, all throwing up once together, water pouring from their mouths in unconvincing streams, then they all fall asleep, these are the phases which all happen really early in the movie. Then, they all say \"Good\" together when asked how they are, and that's it. That's the virus done, nothing else happens.There could have been so much more done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus and it protecting them from all manner of harm. It could have explored a serious change of these characters as it infected and took over them, it could have developed these characters, shown them making decisions and doing things that connect back to their character shown in flashbacks to the interviews.The ending isn't even confusing, intriguing or thought provoking. It just shows something that happens and that's it, although in the long, drawn out style with the irritating voice over above it. I really struggled with this movie and watched a number of Press members walk out (including one famous TV critic leaving within the first twenty minutes), I stayed, but regretted the lost time.", "This is the largest study so far to assess the complex relationship between quality management strategies and patient experience with care. Our findings suggest absence of and wide variations in the institutionalization of strategies to engage patients in quality management, or implement strategies to improve patient-centeredness of care. Seemingly counterintuitive inverse associations could be capturing a scenario where hospitals with poorer quality management were beginning to improve their patient experience.

Terror in the night:Bullets pierced the wall of the bedroom where the 8-year-old and his 17-year-old brother were in bed at her home in Culver City . His head was partially shaved and marred by two long, stapled incisions. Speaking to NBC Los Angeles, Leo said he looks forward to playing sports again. 'They had to open up his skull and take it out, and now he has 23 staples,' said his mother, Teresa Bernal. Police have asked the public's help in finding the gunman who opened fire at around 11.55pm Sunday inside the boy' home in the Del Rey neighborhood near Venice Beach. Traumatized: Teresa Bernal, Leo's mother, said her son was scared to go back home . The boy had just been put to bed when his father heard the unlocked security door and front door open and thought it was his 20-year-old son returning, police said. Instead, a stranger wearing a hooded sweatshirt entered, exchanged a few words and then began shooting at and chasing the father, according to the family's account. Bullets pierced the wall of the bedroom where the 8-year-old and his 17-year-old brother were in bed. The father told police he ran into the boy's bedroom and tried to shield him as the gunman followed, still firing. 'It was a matter of seconds, just bam! Bam! Bam!,' Leo's mother told the NBC station. 'Fourteen shots, all pointed into my kid's room.' The boy's brother, parents and grandmother escaped unharmed. Detectives are seeking a motive for the attack. Meanwhile, Leo's mother said Leo is scared to go home. 'Who wants to go back to that? It's like the nightmare,' she said. 'My son [has been] crying about going home. He doesn't want to go home. He's horrified.' The hospital offered the family a few free nights at a hotel and a pamphlet for social services, KNBC-TV reported. The family have set up a GoFundMe account to raise 50,000 towards Leo's medical costs.", "Caterham, England - In a bizarre turn of events, a group of three men decided to shed their clothes before attempting to rob an Esso gas station in Caterham. Although not all of the suspects were nude, two of the alleged criminals stripped down before entering the premises. Police have since released CCTV images showing the partially clothed individuals responsible for the crime. Remarkably, the men managed to flee the scene with only one staff member's mobile phone, leaving without any cash from the register. Authorities have announced that a third suspect, who did not disrobe during the incident, is currently under arrest and has been placed on police bail. Both the police and the community are puzzled as to the reasoning behind the unconventional approach to this attempted robbery. Gas station staff members remained unharmed throughout the ordeal, and the investigation is ongoing. Police are hoping that the release of the CCTV images will assist in identifying the nude perpetrators and bring them to justice. Locals have reacted with a mix of amusement and concern, questioning the men's motives behind their peculiar choice of attire - or lack thereof. Some speculate that they were attempting to make a statement, while others believe it may have been a dare or prank gone wrong. The incident has certainly left the Caterham community questioning the sanity and intentions of those involved. As the investigation continues, residents will undoubtedly be on guard against any further naked encounters in their neighborhood. Anyone with information regarding the identity of the two unclothed would-be raiders is asked to contact the police immediately, in hopes that they can be apprehended and questioned about their unusual method for attempting a robbery.", "Person1: Hello?

'Leila goes to a women's place with me but every day they say we don't have a room,' she said. Scroll down for video . Leila Alavi had taken out an apprehended violence order against her ex-husband Mokthar Hosseiniamraei . Her body was found by a distressed colleague inside her Holden Astra with initial examination suggesting Ms Alavi had suffered a knife wound to the throat. A spokeswoman for the advocacy group SOS Women's Services, Roxanne McMurray, told the Sydney Morning Herald that Ms Alavi would likely have been able to survive the violence if she was given access to a refuge at the time of her search. Police alleged that a history of domestic violence was inflicted on Ms Alavi. Her ex-partner, Mokthar Hosseiniamraei, stood accused of murder during a hearing at Parramatta Local Court in January. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia in January, Ms Alavi's distressed co-worker at the Benjamin Hair Studio, said she didn't know 'how or why this happened.' Another colleague revealed it was not unusual for Ms Alavi to meet her estranged husband. 'I've seen him over 10,000 times,' Meneske Cinar told theDaily Telegraph.

But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a actionthriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent militarypolicesheriffagentmarshal figure. The special effects are well, \"special\" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.Spoilers...A good portion of the movie's events are predictable, from the helicopter crash Pull up, pull up!, to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.", "It is possible for bacterial meningitis to occur secondary to stapes footplate malformation in a child with an auditory brainstem implant. The stapes footplate is a part of the middle ear, and malformation in this region can lead to recurrent ear infections, which can increase the risk of meningitis. Additionally, the placement of an auditory brainstem implant, which requires surgery, can increase the risk of meningitis by introducing the possibility of bacterial infection during or after the procedure. However, it is important to note that this is a very specific scenario, and the risk of meningitis will depend on various factors, such as the child's overall health, the presence of other risk factors for meningitis (e.g. immune system deficiencies), and the success of the surgical procedure for the auditory brainstem implant. It is essential to follow all post-operative care instructions, monitor for any signs of infection, and stay up-to-date with routine vaccinations to reduce the risk of meningitis in children who have undergone surgery for auditory brainstem implants.", "Yes, positive selection in octopus haemocyanin can indicate functional links to temperature adaptation. Haemocyanin is a copper-containing respiratory protein found in mollusks, including octopuses, that functions to transport oxygen in the blood. Some studies suggest that positive selection in haemocyanin genes may be associated with adaptations to different thermal environments. Octopuses are ectothermic animals, meaning their body temperature is determined by their surrounding environment. Their ability to adapt to different water temperatures relies on the efficiency of their oxygen transport system. Haemocyanin plays an essential role in this system and its function can depend on the temperature of the surrounding water. In a study of octopus haemocyanin, researchers found evidence of positive selection and rapid evolution of the molecule in Antarctic octopuses, suggesting a relationship between haemocyanin function and survival in cold, oxygen-rich habitats. This positive selection appears to be driving functionally relevant amino acid replacements in Antarctic octopus haemocyanin that may help improve oxygen-binding affinity at low temperatures. Similarly, haemocyanin from warm-adapted octopuses is suggested to have greater thermal stability than that of cold-adapted octopuses. This difference could also be the result of directional selection for temperature-dependent functional optimization in haemocyanin. In conclusion, positive selection in octopus haemocyanin can indeed indicate functional links to temperature adaptation, as evidence suggests that the process may enhance oxygen transport efficiency under different thermal environments.", "Bean, Kevin Perry, UK TV creations that have made successful transitions onto the BIG screen, brings a delightful variety of laughter and humor that will have viewers chuckling in amusement.

Highly recommended for anyone in need of a good laugh and light-hearted entertainment!", "Joe Rogan's whole act is profanity laced with bile. He is a pot smoker who entered Fear Factor, thinking it was a joke. He said he would egg people on because he did not know how stupid people were going to be. The producers of the show he explained were going on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they will go. The level of evil involved is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan's special is just filled with the rants of someone who is too good for regular human beings. I found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians such as Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even does a five minute set on the N word. Overall, ignore this special.", "Assuming the hypothesis of interactions with other chromosomal regions, the QTL could be unambiguously mapped to a 30 cM region delimited by recombination points. The marker-assisted backcrossing design was successfully used to confirm the segregation of a QTL on SSC2 and, because full-sibs that inherited the same alleles from their two parents were analysed, the detection of epistatic interactions could be performed between alleles and not between breeds as usually done with the traditional Line-Cross model. Additional analyses of other recombinant sires should provide more information to further improve the fine-mapping of this locus, and confirm or deny the interaction identified between chromosomes 2 and 13.", "The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other. Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, beneath the surface of these erotic overtones, lies a deep and touching storyline that brings healing and redemption to the main characters. Both Lazarus (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) and Rae (a riveting performance by Christina Ricci) deliver raw and emotionally charged depictions of their struggles with individual traumas and societal expectations. The cinematography beautifully captures the raw nature of the rural landscape, adding another layer of depth to the story. The film delves into the darkness of the human psyche and the power of healing through unconventional connections. The slow-building relationship between Lazarus and Rae, anchored by their damaged pasts, evolves into a mutual understanding and acceptance that ultimately saves them both from their personal demons. The movie also features an excellent supporting cast, with standout performances by Justin Timberlake as Rae's boyfriend and S. Epatha Merkerson as Lazarus's disapproving neighbor. One cannot ignore the haunting and soulful blues soundtrack that ties the film together, further emphasizing the pain and catharsis of the characters' journey. In conclusion, while the trailer may have promised a more provocative and sensational film, the final product delivers a powerful and redemptive story of healing and human connection. Bolstered by strong performances and a rich soundtrack, this film is definitely worth watching, as long as viewers are prepared for the intensity of the subject matter and its emotional impact.", "Some people may remember Ms. Russell from films such as \"Black Widow,\" which had some appeal and critical acclaim. Boy, she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this dog.Yes, there will be those who like the gratuitous violence and nudity.

I just saw this movie on one of the \"HBO's,\" and I can't believe they picked it up.In 1996 Ms. Russel didn't have the physical attractiveness she did earlier in her career. But, come on!

It's also creepy in that you think there are going to be incestuous relationships occurring (thank goodness there aren't, hope that doesn't count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added into the cast, this one is B-movie 'straight to video' all the way.The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, either in person or on the phone, are a primer in terrible, terrible acting. Oh, wait, I forgot terrible, terrible writing as well. Chalk this one up to experience. A bad experience.", "Everton manager Roberto Martinez has rejected accusations stubbornness prevents him from adapting his tactical approach. The Spaniard has come in for criticism for persisting with trying to get his side to play out from the back despite results suffering recently. There were even suggestions the players had gone to him asking to play a more direct style but Martinez has always stuck rigidly to his principles, which was the case when he was at Wigan when they were in relegation battles every season.

Everton striker Arouna Kone (right) is tackled by Southampton defender Jose Fonte (left) at Goodison Park . Everton left-back Leighton Baines comes in with a strong challenge on Southampton forward Shane Long . But while he may persist in wanting to play the same way he said that does not mean his tactics are rigid. 'The people who say that I am tactically not flexible are people who do not follow my work,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo. 'I have been innovative at every football club I have been at with my tactics, my shape and my approach. 'I am not someone who needs to defend myself but if you follow my work then I am probably one of the most flexible managers tactically that you could work with.' Martinez tinkered with the shape of his side in Saturday's victory over Southampton, their third successive league win, as he switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation with Gareth Barry the solitary holding midfielder with his regular central partner James McCarthy pushed further forward. He explained he made the change to compensate for the absence of leading scorer Romelu Lukaku, who is still recovering from a hamstring injury. 'It was because we didn't have Romelu,' he added. 'In certain games we played with two strikers. On Saturday we had Aaron Lennon really high up the pitch and James McCarthy had freedom. 'Every game is different. Southampton have a very strong back six that needs to be broken in different ways. 'We don't play the same way twice, but it is not for me to go openly and publicly and tell everyone what we have done.' Martinez insists that his tactics are 'innovative' and points to his changes made against Southampton .

Studies have shown that people with arthritic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), have elevated levels of various factors involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways. These pathways are important for blood clotting and the dissolution of blood clots, respectively. In RA, evidence suggests that the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems are both activated, which contributes to the associated inflammation and joint destruction. For example, increased levels of tissue factor and factor VIII (important players in the coagulation cascade) have been reported in the synovial fluid and blood of RA patients. Moreover, fibrinolysis, the process by which blood clots are broken down, is also impaired in RA patients, contributing to the accumulation of fibrin in the joints, further promoting inflammation and joint damage. In OA, the role of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways is less well established as compared to RA. However, there are indications that both pathways could be implicated in OA pathogenesis as well. Some studies have reported elevated levels of tissue factor, factor X, and thrombin-antithrombin complexes in OA patients, suggesting activation of the coagulation system. Additionally, an imbalance between the levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, which inhibits fibrinolysis) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, which promotes fibrinolysis) in OA joint tissues has been observed, pointing to a potential role for impaired fibrinolysis in OA. In summary, arthritis is linked to local and systemic activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways, which can contribute to inflammation and joint damage. Understanding these pathways' involvement in arthritis might help develop new therapeutic strategies to treat these debilitating conditions.", "Person1: Thanks, Susan.

Despite the immense hype surrounding this film, it fell incredibly short in delivering the entertainment value and cinematic quality that it promised. Firstly, the plot was underdeveloped and filled with cliches, creating a predictable story that left one wanting a more original and engaging experience. The story had great potential, but it barely scratched the surface of what could have been an intriguing exploration into the characters and their motivations. The acting was subpar, with the main characters delivering lackluster performances that did not evoke any connection with the audience. Despite their previous solid track records, the actors seemed uninspired and wooden, making it hard to invest in their journeys. Furthermore, the visuals and cinematography left much to be desired. The film appeared to rely heavily upon CGI and poor green screen effects which were more distracting than awe-inspiring. Rather than providing an immersive experience that transports the viewer into the world of the film, these visual shortcuts stripped away any authenticity and emotional weight that the film could have carried. Lastly, the pacing of the film was disjointed, with multiple storylines vying for attention but ultimately never receiving proper closure or development. What should have been a captivating ride was instead an overwhelming jumble of seemingly unrelated events and characters. Overall, this film is a disappointing watch and does not live up to the high expectations set by the hype and the rave reviews.

Barnett, 25. then shoots Allen dead after he comes at him with the gun, making threatening statements as he does.WARNING: Graphic content . Bodycam footage released this week shows a police officer in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, fatally shooting a man . The bodycam footage shows Donald Allen, 66, pointing a loaded, 22-caliber pistol at officer Brian Barnett, 25 . The camera was malfunctioning and it was thought the video was lost. It was recovered but the audio was not . Deputy Chief of Police Mike Carter played the video at a news conference on Tuesday, Tulsa World reported. The camera was malfunctioning and it was initially thought the video was lost. It was forensically recovered, but the audio from the bodycam was not, Fox 23reported. Carter said: 'We are faced with making decisions that other people normally are not faced with making. 'This officer had to make one of those decisions that day. 'By this video, I think it very clearly shows he made a good decision. 'He made the decision he had to make. 'Don't ever confuse that with a decision that we want to make.' He said he believes the shooting was justified. Barnett shot four times. Officers in Sand Springs have been wearing bodycams for the past seven years and the early April incident was the first officer-involved shooting in 17 years in the town. Allen, a Vietnam veteran, was shooting a gun in his backyard when police were called, according to News on 6. His wife told police he was a paranoid schizophrenic and had been off his medication for a year. Deputy chief Carter added: 'Mr Allen is a victim. 'He's a victim of mental illness, he's a victim of the system. 'This was a tragic incident. 'It's something we hope we are never placed in the position of happening again.' All the recordings have been turned over to the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office. Barnett remains on administrative leave pending an investigation by the Tulsa County DA.

South West trains warned passengers of cancellations on all services and Network Rail staff worked \"flat out\" to resolve the situation. The track closure affected a vital route carrying passengers from central London to stations in the suburbs, leaving many stranded and scrambling to find alternative means of transportation. While Network Rail has not revealed the cause of the issue, it apologized to its passengers for the inconvenience caused. As the disruption unfolded, several passengers took to social media to express their frustration. Images shared on Twitter showed huge crowds at London Waterloo station, as facilities were stretched to provide for the hundreds of delayed travelers. South West trains operated an emergency timetable during the peak travel hours, with the company warning passengers to expect \"significant delays.\" Travelers were also urged to avoid traveling if possible and to make alternative arrangements, and if necessary, seek alternative routes into London. Network Rail issued a statement commending its staff for working \"flat out\" to fix the problem and assured passengers that the situation would soon be rectified. South West trains later confirmed that the line had been partially reopened, allowing a limited number of trains to run, but warned that disruption would likely continue into today. This latest disruption to London's transport network comes just weeks after a major power failure left thousands of homes without electricity, and stranded passengers at various airports and train stations across the country.

Geriatric psychiatry services typically deal with older adults who may be at risk for, or have experienced, various forms of abuse or neglect. It is important for mental health professionals working in this field to be able to identify the signs of elder abuse and neglect and to be aware of potential risk factors that can contribute to such situations. Some common types of elder abuse include physical, emotional, sexual, financial, and neglect. Risk factors associated with elder abuse and neglect may include cognitive impairment, social isolation, mental illness, age-related health issues, and caregiver stress. By understanding the prevalence and correlates of elder abuse and neglect in geriatric psychiatry services, mental health professionals can develop intervention strategies, preventative measures, and appropriate treatments for affected individuals. Additionally, raising awareness within the broader community can help to reduce the stigma associated with discussing and reporting elder abuse and neglect.", "Motherwell Football Club has announced that they will offer free entry to their regular fans if the team ends up in the play-off competition, challenging a standing rule in which the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is entitled to 50 of gate proceeds from play-off games. The club has stated that they will provide free tickets to fans in the event of finishing in 11th place, a decision that has received support from Rangers and Hibernian football clubs. Currently sitting in 11th place in the league table, Motherwell is at risk of being part of the play-off battles. The club's board has made a bold stand against the SPFL by insisting that if Motherwell reaches the relegation play-off final, they will allow their season ticket holders to attend for free. This move is a direct challenge to the SPFL's rules, which demand that 50 of gate proceeds from these crucial games are handed over to the league body. In a statement, Motherwell said, \"The board at Fir Park are acutely aware of the financial pressures on its supporter base. Should we be involved in the play-off final, we don't believe it should be an additional cost on top of an already expensive season. Therefore, we have decided that should we be involved in the play-off final at Fir Park on Friday, 22 May, the club will cover the cost of its season ticket holders' entry.\" The move has been appreciated by supporters, as the team currently has around 2,400 season ticket holders who would all be eligible for free entry. However, it remains to be seen how the SPFL will react to the defiance, as the league could lose a significant amount of revenue as a result. Rangers and Hibernian have already expressed their support for Motherwell's stance, with both clubs agreeing that the current distribution of revenues from play-offs is unfair to clubs, particularly those in the lower leagues. Rangers and Hibernian had also previously offered free tickets to season ticket holders in past play-off seasons, only to be slapped with hefty fines by the SPFL. There has been no official word yet from the SPFL on Motherwell's announcement, but it will be interesting to see how the league handles this latest challenge to its rules.", "Only the psychological approach to successful ageing independently predicted QoL at follow-up. Successful ageing is not only about the maintenance of health, but about maximising one's psychological resources, namely self-efficacy and resilience. Increasing use of preventive care, better medical management of morbidity, and changing lifestyles in older people may have beneficial effects on health and longevity, but may not improve their QoL. Adding years to life and life to years may require two distinct and different approaches, one physical and the other psychological. Follow-up health status, number of supporters and social activities, and self-rated active ageing also significantly predicted QoL at follow-up. The longitudinal sample bias towards healthy survivors is likely to underestimate these results.", "Contains Spoilers: This is a Peter Watkins film, and knowing that, one expects a certain level of political awareness and commentary. \"Punishment Park\" does not disappoint on that front. The film is a stunning and gripping indictment of the government's suppressive measures towards political dissent, as well as an exploration of the limits of human morality. Set in an alternate 1970s America, \"Punishment Park\" follows a diverse group of citizens labeled as political radicals and criminals, who are given an ultimatum: face lengthy prison sentences or survive three days in a grueling desert obstacle course pursued by national guardsmen and law enforcement officers, the eponymous Punishment Park. Shot in a mockumentary style, Watkins expertly uses the gritty realism of his handheld camera and non-professional actors to underline the sense of urgency and jeopardy in the characters' dire predicament. The film shifts between heart-wrenching tribunal scenes where the defendants argue passionately for their freedom, and the violent and cruel cat-and-mouse game in the desert. The film's most striking feature is its deftness in criticizing both the American government's methods of stifling dissent and the behavior of those in power. The harsh treatment of prisoners is disturbingly relevant today, even though the film was made five decades ago. \"Punishment Park\" forces the viewer to question the morality of their government and confront the chilling possibility of a near-future dystopia. It also shows the extent to which law enforcement is willing to go to maintain order and authority, only escalating the fear and tension within the characters and the audience. In terms of performances, the largely improvised dialogue lends an air of authenticity to the characters, making them relatable and their struggles all the more heart-wrenching. Watkins also masterfully inserts moments of quiet introspection amidst the chaos, adding a level of depth and empathy to the characters. Overall, \"Punishment Park\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that leaves a lasting impact. Its social commentary on politics, military power, and governmental control remains eerily relevant today. If you are a fan of Peter Watkins or politically-themed cinema, this film is a must-watch. Just be prepared for a gut-wrenching and intense experience.", "Retiring jockey AP McCoy insists he will not repeat Sir Steve Redgrave's U-turn Tony McCoy, the retiring jockey from Northern Ireland, has vowed to never return to professional horse racing, going as far as saying, \"shoot me if I ride professionally again.\" The 41-year old rider retires after two decades of racing, with more than 4,000 career wins under his belt. McCoy's determined exit from professional racing conjures memories of Olympian Steve Redgrave's proclamation in 1996 when he said, \"If anyone sees me near a boat, you've got my permission to shoot me.\" However, Redgrave later made a triumphant return to competitive rowing, claiming his fifth consecutive Olympic gold at Sydney 2000. Although there have been speculations of a possible U-turn in his decision to retire, McCoy is adamant about his departure from the sport. The decorated jockey acknowledges the similarities between his and Redgrave's statements but maintains that he will not make a comeback. Although fans may be sad to see him retire, Tony McCoy leaves an impressive legacy behind in the world of horse racing and will always be remembered as one of the greatest competitors of the sport.", "Person1: Hey, Frank.

Microarray analysis suggests that the processes engaged by this sleep are consistent with its function. Thus, active period deep sleep appears temporally misaligned but mechanistically intact, leading to the following: first, aged brain tissue appears capable of generating the slow waves necessary for deep sleep, albeit at a weaker intensity than in young. Second, this activity, presented during the active period, seems disruptive rather than beneficial to cognition. Third, this active period deep sleep may be a cognitively pathologic attempt to recover age-related loss of inactive period deep sleep. Finally, therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing active period deep sleep (e.g., by promoting active period wakefulness andor inactive period deep sleep) may be highly relevant to cognitive function in the aging community.", "Motherwell have vowed to go to battle with the SPFL over the issue of free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders. And the Fir Park side are set to win powerful backing for their revolt from Championship promotion challengers Rangers and Hibernian. Under existing rules, the SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds from the six play-off ties for redistribution among the clubs. But a bid by the league board to force play-off finalists to charge all fans a minimum price of 15 for the play-off ties was withdrawn at a meeting last Thursday. Motherwell will go to battle with the SPFL over free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holders . Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish 11th . Expressing unease among the play-off finalists that the SPFL might be using the ties to milk supporters, Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish in the Premiership play-off place. 'All our focus at Motherwell in the next four games is fully on avoiding the play-offs altogether,' said Burrows. 'We fully accept and appreciate that there are rules on this in place. 'But, in the eventuality that we are in 11th place come the play-offs, then it is not our intention to charge our season-ticket holders for the play-off final at Fir Park. 'We believe we have sold them tickets which entitle them to the full story of the season.' Rangers sources said last night that the club have yet to reach a final decision on whether to seek an SPFL exemption which would allow them to let their 25,000 season ticket holders into play-off games for free. The SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds but Motherwell want to offer free tickets . Hibs gained a one-off dispensation to give their most loyal fans free admission to last season's home play-off clash with Hamilton. Sportsmail understands, however, that SPFL lawyers have already warned clubs that attempts to do the same this season will be strongly resisted as it would constitute a breach of league rules. Last week, a resolution by Hibs and Motherwell to have the 50-per-cent levy on play-off gates cut in half was defeated. Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor . Accused of a cash grab to keep more of the play-off cash, Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor for the last two seasons. Asked if he expects a fight on the matter from league chiefs, Burrows admitted: 'Based on what has gone previously, then yes.' .", "Person1: Hey Rocky! You've been sitting around all night.

At first glance, one might dismiss it as just another relic of a bygone era, but there is more to this film than meets the eye. For starters, the cinematography is surprisingly refreshing and creative; it showcases an intricate attention to detail and framing that elevates it beyond typical adult films. The movie uses striking floral motifs and stylish sets reflective of its time, giving it a touch of artistic flair. Moreover, the soundtrack complements and enhances the romantic escapades on-screen with funk, soul, and disco tunes, enveloping the viewer in a nostalgic wave that adds to the overall experience. Surprisingly, the acting is notably well-executed, with characters that exude charisma and charm. This makes it easier to invest in their connections and sympathize with their situations, elements often lacking in adult films. The chemistry between the actors is undeniable, making each scene palpable and engaging, with a mix of playful banter and steamy encounters. Furthermore, the storyline is somewhat developed, maintaining a steady narrative pace. The movie features some unexpected plot twists and semi-realistic scenarios, which makes it feel more like a mainstream film with explicit content, rather than just another run-of-the-mill adult flick. The film's explicit scenes are tastefully portrayed, with a balance between sensuality and raw passion. The camera work in these scenes does not shy away from the sensuality of the viewer and focuses on positions and angles that emphasize the emotional connection between the characters. There is a level of eroticism that is both explicit yet refined, making the movie suitable for audiences seeking a blend of intimacy and passion. That being said, the film is certainly outdated in terms of its dialogue, pacing, and societal norms. Some may find the movie's sexism and lack of modern diversity to be off-putting, hence the 7 points rating and not something higher. In conclusion, this 1974 adult film offers more than just skin-deep appeal. With its creative cinematography, engaging acting, funky soundtrack and unexpected plot, it is a movie that can be appreciated by vintage adult film enthusiasts who can overlook the inherent flaws in presentation.", "This movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies I have seen...

The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur.

Rezaian and his wife were arrested in July for unspecified allegations. The charges brought against him were made public last week, after a long and suspenseful wait. Both the Washington Post and the State Department have deemed the charges against Rezaian absolutely \"absurd.\" They are standing by their employee throughout this difficult time and it appears that clearer information will be required to have him released from custody. The Washington Post's Executive Editor, Martin Baron, has also made statements to reinforce their position in supporting Rezaian. \"Any charges brought against Jason Rezaian are absurd, should be immediately dismissed, and he should be immediately freed from custody,\" Baron said. Representatives from the State Department have also released statements in defense of Rezaian and the charges against him. \"We just wanted to say on the record that that's absurd, about as silly as the very idea of a secret underground lair where he was waging untold war against the brutal Mullahcracy,\" said State Department officials. Fans and supporters of Rezaian have voiced their concerns for his case and how it has been handled. Many are questioning why Jason and his wife were arrested in the first place and are demanding further explanation for these \"absurd\" charges.", "Recent changes in the format of the ABSITE to a 2-tiered examination in 2006 and subsequent plan to return to a unified test for all PGY levels has made preparation difficult. With a more focused, question-based approach to studying, residents may see a demonstrable improvement in their scores. Our study supports this hypothesis-showing that residents who complete more review questions had higher ABSITE percentile scores. In the past, it has been demonstrated that strong ABSITE scores are associated with higher written board scores. With the widespread adoption of the Surgical Council on Resident Education curriculum, we postulate that residency programs that rely on this review question-based curriculum will report improved ABSITE percentile scores and written board pass rates.", "Major General James Post III fired over A-10 Warthog \"treason\" comment Last week, Major General James Post III was fired after expressing his opinion on the retirement of the A-10 Warthog aircraft, stating that the decision amounted to 'treason.' His highly debated opinion has added fuel to an already existing controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer plane, which is widely renowned by ground troops. Post defended himself by stating that his choice of the term \"treason\" was for dramatic effect, rather than a legal statement. However, his decision to voice his opinions has left some questioning whether it was right that his comments led to his dismissal. Major General Post previously held the position of Vice Commander of Air Combat Command, and reportedly made the controversial statement during a discussion in a room full of officers back in January, 2015. Post is reported to have said, \"If anyone accuses me of saying this, I will deny it ... anyone who is passing information to Congress about A-10 capabilities is committing treason.\" However, Post has since said that the context of his statements has been misunderstood. He stated that the Air Force did not want to retire the A-10 Warthog, but felt that it had no other choice due to existing budget constraints. Despite the other implications of his statements, Post's use of the term \"treason\" has led to his firing, ending his 32-year career. He expressed remorse for his actions by saying \"The objective of my comment was simply meant to focus the attention of the audience on working within the command's constraints.\" The A-10 Warthog has provided the US with four decades of military service, which has included seeing ground-attack action in Iraq, Afghanistan, and most recently against ISIS.", "The cloaked similarity between HIV-1 and SARS-CoV might suggest potential strategies for developing treatments against SARS-CoV. Both viruses use a similar mechanism to evade the host immune system, such as the presence of the envelope glycoproteins that are concealed under sugar molecules (glycans). However, despite the similarity in their glycan shielding, the two viruses have different structures, replication mechanisms, and target cells. An effective treatment or strategy for one virus may not necessarily work for the other virus. Nonetheless, studying the similarities between the two viruses may help identify potential targets for antiviral therapies and vaccines. Researchers can leverage the knowledge gained from HIV research to inform the development of SARS-CoV (and SARS-CoV-2) treatment strategies. Studying the glycan shielding in HIV has led to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against the virus, and similar strategies could be explored for SARS-CoV as well. However, it is important to note that HIV and SARS-CoV are fundamentally different viruses, with SARS-CoV being a coronavirus, and HIV-1 being a lentivirus (a type of retrovirus). Therefore, while similarities in certain aspects may guide researchers in identifying potential strategies, it is essential to consider the unique aspects of each virus when developing treatments.", "'Kondogbia was incredible for Monaco, he was exactly the player Arsenal needed to sign,' Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp said back in February. The French midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the Emirates Stadium as the Ligue 1 side all-but-sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League after a 3-1 first-leg win. But rather than Arsenal, it now seems Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. So, what more do you need to know? Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is a Liverpool target and has also interested Arsenal in recent years . 22? He's been around for a while... Despite his young age, Kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for Lens, Monaco, and even Sevilla. And during that five-year professional career, the central midfielder has been constantly watched by Arsenal scouts. He also impressed at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup alongside Paul Pogba in the French midfield, while his frame and playing style doesn't exactly scream 22 years old. Kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with Lens (above), Sevilla and Monaco . The central midfielder was a key player for France alongside Paul Pogba at the Under 20 World Cup in 2013 . Tough guy then? Exactly. Standing at 6'2,\" Kondogbia is a real presence in the Monaco midfield, allowing the likes of Joao Moutinho to strut their stuff further forward. He's strong in the tackle, but make no mistake, his prowess on the ball is also impressive. Possessing a fine left foot, Kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker, and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against Arsenal. Having made his mark in both Ligue 1 and La Liga, you could say the Frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder, someone who would fit in seamlessly in the Premier League... Kondogbia's fine strike put Monaco in front against Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg . So why haven't we seen him in England? Time is still on Kondogbia's side, but Premier League clubs have certainly tried. Arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left Sevilla, though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for Monaco. With Liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageingdeparting spine, the 22-year-old's presence would surely suit Brendan Rodgers. But he must move quick, withReal Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team. Mesut Ozil swapped shirts with Kondogbia at half-time in the second leg at the Stade Louis II .", "I like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. Their performances were truly captivating as they each brought their unique touch to their eccentric characters. The plot may have been far-fetched, but it was the undeniable chemistry between the actors that made this film a wild, memorable ride. The art direction and set design deserve a special mention as they managed to create a visually stunning world that was both surreal and intriguing. From the moments of striking color contrasts to the whimsical scenery, the film was a feast for the eyes. However, the film's erratic pacing and seemingly endless twists and turns did make for a somewhat confusing viewing experience. The disjointed storyline may have been intentional to match the bizarre premise, but it certainly left some viewers scratching their heads. Overall, this movie was a roller coaster of surreal visuals, mesmerizing performances, and a convoluted plot that has managed to spark countless conversations and debates. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, those looking for a unique and unexpected cinematic experience will definitely appreciate this peculiar gem.", "AP McCoy Rides Don Cossack to Victory in Melling Chase Jockey AP McCoy has won the Melling Chase at the Randox Grand National Festival, riding horse Don Cossack to victory during one of the event's most anticipated races on Friday.

McCoy, 45, demonstrated once again why he's considered a legend in horse racing, expertly guiding Don Cossack through a thrilling race that only cemented his reputation as a jockey not to be underestimated. The victory comes during a festival in which McCoy announced he would be retiring from racing this year.", "ASCENDING to power in 1933, Hitler and his \"National Socialist German Workers Party,\" which of course we all know as the Nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as time went by. This chilling and gripping story is expertly portrayed in the movie, \"The Rise and Fall.\" The film seamlessly weaves together the personal and the political, giving us an intimate portrait of a leader and his loyal followers while revealing the dangerous ideologies and ruthless tactics that swept through the nation. The cinematography and the visuals of 1930s Germany are hauntingly beautiful, effortlessly capturing the sinister mood of the time. The director deftly balances the wide-reaching ramifications of the regime with the human aspect of the story, allowing us to deeply understand and empathize with both the victims and the perpetrators of the Holocaust. The movie doesn't shy away from the horrors but also doesn't indulge in them gratuitously, striking the perfect balance between historical accuracy and narrative sensitivity. The ensemble cast featuring both seasoned actors and up-and-coming stars bring their awe-inspiring performances, fully embodying the complex characters they portray. The unapologetically authentic portrayals of these individuals make the events of the time feel more real and accessible to modern audiences. What sets \"The Rise and Fall\" apart from other films of this genre is its ability to offer fresh insights into the events of this dark chapter in history. By providing political, social, and psychological context, it complicates the narrative and challenges the simplistic notion of the Nazis as pure \"villains.\" Instead, it forces the viewers to confront the unsettling truth of how ordinary people can be swept up in a tide of evil and violence when they have been manipulated and led astray. In conclusion, \"The Rise and Fall\" is a masterfully crafted film that effortlessly captures the essence of one of history's darkest periods. With its unflinching portrayal of the turmoil, captivating performances, and fresh insights, this movie is an important and chilling reminder of the capability of humanity for both greatness and depravity. It is not only a must-watch for history buffs but also an essential viewing for anyone who wishes to understand the dangers of blind obedience and the consequences of apathy in the face of injustice.", "Xabi Alonso: Following the Steps of European Football Legend Clarence Seedorf Former Liverpool and Real Madrid star, Xabi Alonso, has a chance to emulate the incomparable success of European football legend, Clarence Seedorf, as his current team, Bayern Munich, prepares to face Porto in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final. Seedorf is known for his incredible record as the only player to have won the UEFA Champions League with three different clubs - Ajax, Real Madrid, and twice with AC Milan. Alonso's illustrious career stands out as he secured victories in the UEFA Champions League with both Liverpool and Real Madrid. During his first season with Liverpool, Alonso scored the critical equalizing goal that led to the club's victory. The talented Spaniard was also part of Real Madrid's triumphant side last season. Now, as a crucial player for Bayern Munich, Alonso has an opportunity to join Seedorf in the renowned status of winning the prestigious European title with three clubs. The highly anticipated quarter-final match against Porto will be the first step in achieving this extraordinary feat. Xabi Alonso's journey to potentially matching Clarence Seedorf's exceptional record highlights the incredible skill and passion of these two elite football players. As fans eagerly await the outcome of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final, the possibilities for both Bayern Munich and the legendary Xabi Alonso are limitless.", "Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), has been shown to significantly improve overall survival for patients with advanced melanoma. Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011, there have been several clinical updates on the use of ipilimumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma. 1. Combination therapy: Combining ipilimumab with other immunotherapeutic agents, such as anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab and pembrolizumab, has demonstrated improved response rates compared to monotherapy. A phase III trial (CheckMate-067) showed that the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab resulted in improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared with ipilimumab alone or nivolumab alone. 2. Adjuvant therapy: Adjuvant ipilimumab therapy has been studied in resected stage III melanoma patients. The phase III EORTC 18071 trial demonstrated a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival in patients receiving ipilimumab compared to placebo. 3. Optimizing dosing and schedules: Newer clinical trials have explored different dosages, durations, and schedules of ipilimumab administration to optimize efficacy and minimize side effects. For instance, reducing the dose of ipilimumab when given in combination with nivolumab may result in a better safety profile without compromising treatment benefits. 4. Predictive biomarkers: Identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to benefit from ipilimumab treatment remains an ongoing area of research. Factors like baseline tumor size, early changes in tumor burden, and immune-related gene signatures may help select patients more likely to respond to the therapy. 5. Managing immune-related adverse events: Clinical experience has led to improved management strategies for ipilimumab's immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as rash, diarrhea, hepatitis, and hypophysitis. Early recognition and the use of immunosuppressive medications like corticosteroids or other immune-modulating drugs have helped manage these side effects while maintaining treatment efficacy. In conclusion, ipilimumab has significantly impacted the treatment of advanced melanoma, with ongoing research focused on optimizing its use, minimizing side effects, and identifying predictive biomarkers for optimal patient selection.", "Person1: Awful!

At low amplitudes of stimulation, nerve monitoring has high sensitivity and negative predictive value but low specificity and positive predictive value, related to the high rate of false positives. At high levels of stimulation, specificity and negative predictive value are high, sensitivity is low, and the positive predictive value rises as the rate of false negatives increase and the rate of false positives decrease. A stimulation level of 0.5 mA optimizes the predictive value of nerve monitoring; however, stimulation at multiple levels significantly improves the predictive value of intraoperative nerve monitoring.", "DNA barcoding works in practice as a tool for species identification and discovery, but there may be some discrepancies when it comes to neutral theory. In practice, DNA barcoding involves using a standardized fragment of DNA (usually a gene sequence that is highly conserved across different species) to differentiate and identify species. The method has been successful in addressing issues of species identification, discovering cryptic species, and in biodiversity assessments. On the other hand, neutral theory is a concept in evolutionary biology that suggests that genetic diversity within populations is mostly driven by genetic drift and mutation, rather than selection. In other words, most observed genetic variation is functionally neutral, i.e., it doesn't affect the fitness of an organism. In the context of DNA barcoding, neutral theory highlights potential issues with using conserved gene sequences for species identification because there may be significant variation in these sequences that is irrelevant to the species' functional characteristics. For this reason, DNA barcoding might not align perfectly with neutral theory, since it largely relies on the assumption that small genetic differences between the sequences being compared are sufficient to differentiate species. However, while this may be a theoretical limitation, DNA barcoding has been shown to be an effective tool in practice for many applications. Careful consideration in choosing appropriate DNA sequences for barcoding and understanding the limitations of the method are necessary for its continued success.", "(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren insists she's not running for president. But her description of a 2016 \"dream\" presidential candidate sounds a lot like, well, her. Warren, during an appearance Friday on CNN's \"New Day,\" said she wanted to see someone willing to fight for the middle class and \"make Washington work for families again.\" Warren says she feels that Washington functions well for special interest groups and the well-connected but leaves out the rest of the nation. \" (I've) spent my whole life studying what's happening to America's middle class and watching year by year, one blow after another,\" she said. \"We live in an America now where the game is rigged, where Washington works really great for those who hire armies of lobbyists, armies of lawyers. It's just not working so well for the rest of America.\" Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, also got specific with her wish list, mentioning that a candidate willing to lower the interest rates on student loans and shore up Social Security would get high marks from her. What the economy means for 2016 . She wouldn't say which of the slew of declared or yet-to-declare candidates fit that bill, but she did want to give all of them a chance as the 2016 campaign kicks off. \"I really want to give everybody who gets in this race a chance to get out there and put their agenda in front of us,\" she said. However, Warren said the two Republican candidates who have gotten into the race Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have already disqualified themselves in her eyes because of how they've voted in Congress. \"I've watched them vote,\" Warren said. \"They voted against the Social Security benefits increase. They voted against reducing the interest rate on student loans.\" Opinion: Can Democrats really take on Wall Street? Warren, a former special adviser for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is something of a political rock star in the eyes of many liberal and progressive voters because of her populist leanings and her passionate calls for an end to income inequality. Many of them want her to get into the race and become a viable challenger to Democratic frontrunner Hilary Clinton.

Titled \"Bridges of the Past,\" the film explores the intricate connections between people who discover that their ancestors have crossed paths throughout history. The movie features a stellar ensemble cast that brings some truly memorable characters to life. From a lovelorn woman trying to discover her roots to a history professor who finds himself entangled in his own investigations, each character's journey masterfully intertwines with one another as they attempt to uncover secrets hidden deep within the city's historical past. Kudos to director Milan Kubes for crafting a multilayered story that keeps you guessing until the very end! What I found particularly fascinating was the rich portrayal of Prague's culture and history, with its cobblestone streets, ancient bridges, vibrant nightlife, and more. The film makes you feel as if you are right there in the heart of the city, exploring and uncovering mysteries yourself. The screenplay, written by Jiri Polak, is sharp and witty, with snappy dialogue that never descends into cliche. The film expertly balances moments of drama and suspense with lighter comedic scenes, providing a sense of balance to what might have otherwise felt like a heavy-handed story. The cinematography is also top-notch, with sweeping shots that capture the beauty of Prague and intimate scenes that make you feel like a fly on the wall. However, the film's true strength lies in its themes of fate, connection, and the impact of our ancestors on our lives. \"Bridges of the Past\" poses profound questions about whether we are truly in control of our destinies or merely pawns in a vast, interconnected web of events. While the film offers no definitive answers, it invites the viewer to ponder these concepts long after the credits roll. In conclusion, \"Bridges of the Past\" is a must-see for those who enjoy thought-provoking stories, breathtaking visuals, and strong performances. While it is deeply rooted in the city of Prague, the film extends its reach beyond the Czech Republic, resonating with viewers around the world. Do yourself a favor and catch this beautifully crafted gem before it leaves theaters.", "I collect films on Super-8, and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on E-bay.

However, the observation that brooding females and females 24 hours FOR did not catch prey within the trial period indicates that maternal care significantly reduces predatory efficiency in these scorpions. Females 28 days FOR were still not as efficient at catching prey as non-gravid and gravid females, suggesting that reproductive costs extend for at least 4 weeks after the end of the maternal care period. Preferential use of an active foraging strategy by brooding females may increase prey encounter rates, allowing the scorpions to more rapidly replenish energy reserves depleted during reproduction. However, active foraging may be energetically costly and increase predation risk for brooding females. Our findings regarding antagonistic interactions between reproduction and feeding in female C. sculpturatus demonstrate the pervasive nature of reproductive costs for viviparous females, and may provide insight on factors that influence the diversity of reproductive strategies observed in nature.", "There is evidence to suggest an association between the COMT val158met polymorphism and peak bone mineral density (BMD) in men.

A study by Allison et al. (2006) showed that thyroid hormone treatment could induce an opsin switch in juvenile Atlantic salmon, leading to a change in their visual sensitivity. This opsin switch is believed to be related to the fish's developmental changes and migration from freshwater to seawater habitats in a process called smoltification. The change in light conditions in these different habitats requires a shift in visual sensitivity, and thyroid hormone may help regulate this adaptive response. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and time-dependent effects of thyroid hormone on opsin expression and visual function in salmonid fish.", "A heroic army dog who lost her entire front leg while clearing a Taliban compound on patrol in Afghanistan has a new home with one of the men she saved.

Despite their unquestionable talents, they find themselves in \"A Walk in the Shadows,\" the latest addition to muddled crime thrillers that fail to land a memorable impact. Both Whitaker and Collins Jr. play detectives assigned to investigate a serial killer's mysterious spree, but their skills are wasted on a script that lacks depth and innovation. Instead, the film sluggishly meanders through a series of cliched action sequences and predictable twists. While it is true that both actors deliver an adequate performance, their on-screen chemistry can't elevate the uninspired dialogue they are given. Consequently, the viewers are left feeling disconnected from their characters and the stakes in this cat-and-mouse game. On a positive note, the film delivers some visually striking cinematography that captures the eeriness of the crime scenes and adds a layer of atmosphere to an otherwise weak ensemble. However, it is not enough to save it from drowning in a sea of similar, stronger genre entries. In the end, \"A Walk in the Shadows\" is a disappointing exploit of Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr.'s remarkable capabilities. Die-hard fans of crime thrillers might find some enjoyment in their performances, but it's unlikely to stand the test of time or generate any buzz.

We need to stay informed and have our voices heard.", "Dug, a heroic and adventurous canine, has made a miraculous recovery after being bitten by a rattlesnake while hiking with his owner, Lindsay Castro, in Fontana, Canada. The pair were enjoying a scenic hike when Lindsay heard the unmistakable sound of a rattle in the brush. Sensing potential danger, she backed away from the area, but Dug bravely ran toward the noise. In the blink of an eye, the venomous snake sprang out and sunk its fangs into Dug's face, causing it to swell to twice its size. Despite the traumatic incident, quick-thinking Lindsay rushed her beloved pet to a nearby veterinarian for emergency treatment. Over the course of two days, Dug underwent intensive antidote therapy to counteract the venom from the rattlesnake bite. Thanks to the swift action of his owner and the skilled veterinary team, the brave four-legged explorer will make a full recovery and is expected to return home soon. The incident serves as a reminder for hikers and pet owners to be aware of their surroundings and to exercise caution when exploring the great outdoors. Lindsay expressed her gratitude towards the veterinary staff and her relief that Dug is now on the mend. She also plans to share her experience with other pet owners and educate them on the importance of being vigilant while out exploring with their furry companions. As for Dug, his courageous act demonstrates the unwavering loyalty and love that our canine companions provide. While his adventurous spirit may have landed him in trouble this time, there is no doubt that he will continue to be a beloved and brave member of Lindsay's family.", "Liverpool jumps ahead of Arsenal for Monaco Star Geoffrey Kondogbia Whilst Arsenal was reportedly scoping out French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia, it looks like Liverpool has pulled ahead in securing the impressive player. After turning in an impressive performance against Arsenal in the Champions League, the 22-year-old star is now at the center of a heated bidding war between the Premier League clubs. Indeed, Arsenal had their eyes set on the player after being impressed with his work at Monaco. However, it seems they have missed their opportunity to acquire the young talent. As former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp commented after Kondogbia put in a Man of the Match performance in Monaco's 3-1 win over Arsenal in the European Cup, \"Arsenal should have signed Kondogbia.\" This could come back to haunt Arsenal, as many critics have pointed out, as Liverpool now leads the Premier League interest in the star. Kondogbia's career took off thanks to spells at Lens and Sevilla before he found his home at Monaco. Today, his potential signing by Liverpool would further underscore tensions between the Premier League clubs.", "Japanese Fish Found in Tsunami Debris Highlights the Impact of Ocean Pollution Oregon authorities have reported the discovery of a Japanese species of fish inside a floating vessel, one of the latest of one million tons of debris dispersed in the Pacific Ocean by the catastrophic tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. The authorities plan to tow the 25-ft piece of fiberglass, significantly highlighting the ongoing impact of ocean pollution. The tsunami, triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, claimed the lives of 18,000 people with powerful waves reaching heights of 128 feet above sea level. A vast amount of debris, including fragments of destroyed cities and infrastructure, was left scattered across the Pacific, causing severe damage to marine ecosystems. This latest discovery showcases the immense scale of the issue and the urgent need for increased efforts to mitigate ocean pollution. The inclusion of a Japanese fish species within the debris is a stark reminder of the interconnectivity of marine ecosystems and the potential for invasive species to be introduced to new habitats as a consequence of pollution. Efforts by authorities have so far resulted in the recovery of tons of debris, including the removal of one 178-ton dock that washed onto the Oregon coast in 2012. However, the challenge remains immense, as the vast majority of the debris remains unaccounted for. With considerable amounts of plastics and microplastics now known to be present throughout the oceans, the race is on to better understand and respond to the multiple threats that our seas face. The Oregon authorities have announced plans to tow the 25-ft piece of fiberglass for further study and eventual disposal, while continuing their efforts to locate and remove other significant pieces of tsunami debris. As investigations deepen, it becomes increasingly crucial to confront the growing issue of ocean pollution and protect the delicate balance of marine ecosystems worldwide.", "A small molecule antagonist of the alpha (v) beta3 integrin could potentially suppress MDA-MB-435 skeletal metastasis. Integrins are cell surface proteins that play a role in cell adhesion and signaling, and the alpha (v) beta3 integrin has been implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The MDA-MB-435 cell line is a human breast cancer cell line that has been associated with aggressive tumor growth and metastasis in organs such as the lung, liver, and bone. There is evidence to support that targeting the alpha (v) beta3 integrin with small molecule antagonists can suppress tumor growth and metastasis in various cancer types, including breast cancer. For example, cilengitide, a cyclic peptide antagonist for alpha (v) beta3 and alpha (v) beta5 integrins, has been shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity and inhibit angiogenesis in several preclinical studies. However, it is essential to note that the specific effect of an alpha (v) beta3 antagonist on the MDA-MB-435 skeletal metastasis would depend on the nature of the antagonist and other factors, such as dosing and administration. Additionally, the effectiveness of such a strategy may vary among individual patients, considering the heterogeneity of cancer. In summary, while small molecule antagonists targeting the alpha (v) beta3 integrin may have potential anti-tumor effects and suppress metastasis in breast cancer cells, more specific studies would be needed to conclusively demonstrate their effectiveness in suppressing MDA-MB-435 skeletal metastasis.", "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reported for jury duty in Rockville, Maryland on Wednesday - and was not selected. The 60-year-old was called to serve on a case involving a car crash and had to answer a couple of questions about his relatives. However, when it came to a question about the jurors legal experience the sitting Judge refrained from making Roberts answer, saying, 'Obviously we know what you do for a living, sir.' Top judge: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts reported for jury duty on Wednesday in Rockville, Maryland . Roberts sat incognito with the other called jurors and answered questions about his sister in Indiana who is a nurse and his brother-in-law, who works with the Indiana State Police. The only giveaway that he was one of the top judges in the highest court in the land and part of the judiciary branch of US Government was the two security staff he brought with him. According to the Washington Post, Roberts squeezed in with the 50 others jurors and was not selected in the case involving a car crash on Connecticitu Avenue from 2013. Judge Rubin asked jurors to raise their hands if they had certain jobs and when it came to medicine, Roberts said his sister was a nurse. Solemn duty: President Barack Obama is sworn in for his second term as President of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2013 . Tagged 'Juror 49', Roberts said he didn't think this disqualified him from the case and neither was the fact his brother-in-law was a cop. When Judge Rubin was about to ask if anyone had legal experience he asked 'Juror 49' to approach the bench and said, 'Sir, good morning. How are you?' 'Very good, thank you' said Roberts. 'I've discussed this with counsel. Obviously we know what you do for a living, sir'. Other Supreme Court Justices have reported for jury duty. Justice Elena Kagan twice has served on a jury and President Obama was summoned for duty in Illinois in 2010.", "Person1: I've had it! I am done working for a company that is taking me nowhere!

RIFLE is an acronym that stands for Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease. It is a classification system used to define the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI). Several studies, including cohort analyses, have demonstrated a strong association between the severity of AKI, as classified by the RIFLE criteria, and hospital mortality in critically ill patients. The higher the RIFLE category, the higher the risk of mortality. For example, a study published in Critical Care in 2007 (Bellomo et al.) involving 120,123 critically ill patients showed that the RIFLE criteria were strongly associated with hospital mortality. In this study, patients in the \"Risk\" category had a 2.07 times higher risk of death, those in the \"Injury\" category had a 3.26 times higher risk, and those in the \"Failure\" category had a 4.92 times higher risk compared to patients without AKI. Hence, RIFLE criteria serve as an important tool for identifying critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and can be utilized to assess prognosis and guide treatment plans.", "Person1: It must have been really cold last night for it to freeze like that.

But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons I hate this man: . He thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours. .

It presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime.The film is a textbook cinema classic, and a masterpiece of creative editing, especially in the famous Odessa Steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed; the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross-cutting. The film contains 1,300 separate shots, and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics. The Battleship Potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world.", "A recent poll revealed that the average Briton consumes 17 cups of tea each week, with one-third of women turning to tea to make them feel better when unwell. The survey, conducted with 2,000 participants across the United Kingdom, also found that tea-drinking habits increase with age. The age-old stereotype of Britons being fanatical about tea has again been confirmed in a recent poll conducted among 2,000 UK residents. The study found that the average Briton drinks 17 cups of tea per week, while almost a third of women seek solace in tea when they are feeling unwell. Of the participants, it was found that tea consumption increases as we grow older. It seems that older Britons have a stronger connection to the ritual of tea-drinking, with many of them likely developing this habit over the years and finding comfort in a cup of tea. In fact, tea has long been considered a remedy for a variety of ailments, from curing a headache to calming an upset stomach. Its antioxidants and soothing warmth make it an appealing option for those looking for a natural remedy during sickness. The survey results indicate that tea is deeply ingrained in British culture, providing a sense of routine and comfort for many people. Britons reportedly drink more than 100 million cups of tea daily, with tea making up around 40 of the total beverage consumption in the country. Despite the prevalence of tea-drinking, the UK still lags behind countries like Turkey and Ireland in per capita consumption. However, with the many ways in which Britons enjoy their tea (black, with milk, or a squeeze of lemon), the versatility of this beloved beverage is undoubtedly a testament to its popularity. Tea-drinking seems to be a matter of both tradition and habit in the UK, and the fact that such a significant percentage of Britons turn to tea when unwell emphasizes the important role this beverage continues to play in the daily lives of people across the country.", "Yes, some studies have found that HER2 amplification is more frequent in lymph node metastases from urothelial bladder cancer than in the primary tumours. A study by Ross et al. (2014) investigated HER2 genetic alterations in primary bladder tumors and their concurrent lymph node metastases. They found that HER2 amplification was more frequent in the lymph node metastases (34) compared to the primary tumors (9). However, more studies are needed to confirm these findings and understand the role of HER2 amplification in urothelial bladder cancer progression and metastasis.", "It seems a late-night dinner at a fancy restaurant or a bouquet of flowers was not enough to make up for what this person had done. But one desperate man has forked out nearly 4000 for a written message in the sky in an attempt to seek forgiveness. Brisbane locals were left scratching their heads after the mysterious message 'I'm sorry' followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses was splashed across the city's clear blue sky on Monday afternoon. The aerial apology hovered above the CBD at about 1pm, prompting several people to jump onto social media to question and voice their theories about who had done what. One desperate man has forked out nearly 4000 for a written message in the sky in a bid to seek forgiveness . The aerial apology was followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses on Monday afternoon . Jordan Miller tweeted on Twitter: 'I'm not sure what he did but that's a big apology!! Lucky he screwed up on a clear day! What if it were overcast?' He followed with another tweet: 'Men of Brisbane. If you've screwed up in the last 24 hrs have your partner look at the sky right now. You're welcome.' ABC reporter Kathy McLeish posted: 'Giant sky-writing apology over Brisbane CBD... Must have been bad..' While the author and recipient remain a mystery, the creation behind the message was Rob Vance, of Skywriting Services Australia, who took just 10 minutes to complete the urgent appeal. 'I'm not sure what he did but that's a big apology!! Lucky he screwed up on a clear day! What if it were overcast?' Jordan Miller tweeted . Locals quickly took to Twitter to question who the mysterious message was directed at . People have jumped to conclusion, believing the man must have done something terribly bad . An ABC reporter also took to Twitter, considering the apology was trying to make up for something bad . But the man who requested it didn't appear to be frantically lovelorn, he said. 'No, he was calm, cool and collected,' Mr Vance told AAP. While you can't put a price on love, Mr Vance said the service usually charged 3990 for up to 10 letters or characters. Interestingly, it's not the first time Mr Vance has made a profit from someone screwing up. 'It's usually along the same lines - someone saying sorry and that's basically it,' he said. \" I'm sorry Barbara' or something like that.'

We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was REALLY that bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles. I did laugh when the head cabin boy is asking Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he's some \"pussy marine.\" The other laughs this film got though had nothing to do with the writing. I would dearly love to know how the people making this movie thought that you could have a cruise liner knocked upside down and have it remain steady.

Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations of breakpoints and the second involving identification of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer with greater caution. Both indicate the complexity of HIV-1 recombination. The resolution would depend critically on development of a recombination analysis algorithm, accumulation of HIV-1 stains, and a higher sequencing quality. With the changes in recombination pattern, phylogenetic relationships of some CRFs may also change. All these results may be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic HIV evolution.", "All those who are into the PC culture are aghast at the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideation andor religious intolerance. Those who don't care about this, but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here. Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public, as evidenced in comments here. What is an interesting premise, which isn't original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film, yet done with gusto. The storyline had potential, but it gets lost in preachy, heavy-handed messaging and caricatured characters. The acting, while earnest, feels overwrought and out of place in many instances, and the dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which only serves to detract from any semblance of genuine emotion. The cinematography and special effects, on the other hand, do little to elevate the film from its shortcomings, opting for generic and unimaginative visuals that could have been pulled from any low-budget genre flick. While the film's intentions may have been noble, or at the very least, intriguing, the execution fell painfully short of delivering anything groundbreaking or memorable. It manages to alienate multiple audience segments with poor choices in storytelling and presentation, ultimately delivering a lackluster product that will leave most viewers unimpressed. In conclusion, this film takes a fascinating idea and dilutes it with misguided principles, amateurish acting, and a disheartening lack of visual flair. It's a movie that won't cater to any particular taste and ends up disappointing on almost every level. It serves as a missed opportunity for what could have been an engaging exploration of spiritual themes and human connection.", "Acidosis alters the cellular metabolism of several major metabolites, which induces a significant degree of metabolic inflexibility. Cells exposed to acidosis largely rely upon mitochondrial metabolism for energy generation to the extent that metabolic intermediates are redirected away from several other critical metabolic processes, including ribose and glutathione synthesis. These alterations lead to both a decrease in cellular proliferation and increased sensitivity to ROS. Collectively, these data reveal a role for p53 in cellular metabolic reprogramming under acidosis, in order to permit increased bioenergetic capacity and ROS neutralization. Understanding the metabolic adaptations that cancer cells make under acidosis may present opportunities to generate anti-tumor therapeutic agents that are more tumor-specific.", "Current research indicates that the ectodomains of LRP1b and LRP4 may have anchorage-independent functions in vivo, but more studies are necessary to provide a solid conclusion. Ectodomains of receptors, like the LDL receptor-related proteins (LRP), often contribute to protein-protein interactions and can play roles in cellular processes, such as signal transduction and endocytosis. LRP1b is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family with a role in cellular lipoprotein homeostasis. Some studies have suggested that LRP1b may function as a tumor suppressor and play a role in inhibiting cell migration and proliferation. LRP1b's ectodomain may have an anchorage-independent function through its ability to bind with various ligands, but further research is needed to confirm these functional roles in vivo. LRP4 (Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 4) is another member of the LDLR family. LRP4's ectodomain has been shown to play a role in the regulation of the Wntbeta-catenin signaling pathway and to bind with various ligands, including agrin and BMPs, which indicate potential anchorage-independent functions. For example, LRP4's ectodomain has been implicated in regulating neuromuscular junction formation and bone development. However, more studies are necessary to better understand the implications of LRP4's ectodomain binding activities in vivo. In conclusion, while there is evidence to suggest that LRP1b and LRP4's ectodomains may have anchorage-independent functions in vivo, more in-depth and targeted studies are needed to provide a definitive answer.", "Person1: Sons is located on the east side of the city, near the downtown area.

The Japanese international admitted that it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from the Blues. Muto has one goal in 11 games for Japan. If the deal goes ahead, Muto will be the first Japanese player to sign for Chelsea. Naoki Ogane, President of Muto's current team FC Tokyo, confirmed that they had received a formal offer from Chelsea. \"It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer,\" Ogane told Sports Nippon. Muto graduated from university with an economics degree two weeks ago, and recently Chelsea signed a 200m sponsorship deal with Yokohama Rubber, a Japanese company. This has generated speculation that the signing of Muto is linked to the sponsorship deal. This signing could be exciting for Chelsea and Muto, as it could open up a whole new fan base for the Premier League team. As the first Japanese player, Muto would likely bring numerous fans with him to support Chelsea. With such a massive sponsorship deal with Yokohama Rubber, who knows what other business partnerships or investments could begin once Muto becomes a Chelsea player.", "Incredible pictures have shown the moment ferocious red sandstorms currently engulfing China devoured a city in the country's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according toThe People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand. 'It also forced the closure of the nearby Mogao Grottoes.' The site is a UNESCO world heritage tourist site renowned for its massive sculptures and frescoes carved in caves along a cliff. Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city yesterday . Traffic was brought to a standstill and residents fled for cover when the storm hit . Two local government officers attempt to sweep the sand off the city's pavements . Cars switched on their lights in order to navigate their way through the billowing sand cloud .

Both disorders are characterized by corneal opacities, and the UBIAD1 gene has been previously associated with SCD. This newly reported mutation might help explain different disease manifestations and further confirm that they may be part of a spectrum of corneal dystrophies caused by mutations in the UBIAD1 gene.

A pair of masked men armed with handguns have robbed three banks in the Pittsburgh area so far this year, most recently on April 10.

However, the way that the two men handle their weapons has led the FBI to suspect that the thieves are actually former police officers themselves. Scroll down for video . Police believe that the two bank robbers suspected in a string of recent heists may have police or military training because of the way they handle a weapon . Authorities say that the robberies, most recently on April 10 (pictured), have become increasingly violent, with the thieves threatening kidnappings and saying they will shoot police if engaged . Surveillance video shows one masked robber holding his finger stretched along the barrel of his gun, just off of the trigger, a safety method used by law enforcement. The men, who wear dark sweatpants and sweatshirts, are also seen jumping over the counter as they begin their heists. 'These folks have some kind of training in firearms, meaning they could be former military, they could be law enforcement, either former or currents,'the FBI's Patrick Fallon said. 'Street punks don't usually use holsters,' he toldWPXI. The men, both 5'8 \" -5'9 \" are described as in excellent physical condition. One of them climbs behind the counter to collect cash as the other threatens bank employees with a gun . The clothes worn during the robberies are thought to be quickly discarded by the robbers, who have also used a very common car as a getaway vehicle . Authorities warned that the criminals have become increasingly aggressive and violent during robberies on January 24, February 21 and April 10. The suspects are described as white, 5'8 \" to 5'9 \" , of medium and larger build and in excellent physical shape, according to CBS Pittsburgh. They were recently seen escaping in a nondescript gray Toyota Corolla, one of the most common cars in the world. Both men are believed to be from Pittsburgh because of their accents. Tt is thought that they quickly get rid of their baggy clothing after making a getaway.

Be it denim, cropped, printed or striped, the wide leg trouser is at the forefront of SS15 trends. There's something effortless about a wide leg trouser that really appeals. And if like us you are growing tired of the skinny jean and want to try out a new look this could be your answer. Louise Redknapp says that a wide-leg trouser can come as a welcome relief from the skinny jean . Skinny jeans have held court for quite a few years now and while they will never go out of style the wide leg will give you an alternative look. It's not the first time this look has made a comeback since the Seventies. Lou tried the out the trend seven years ago with a Stella McCartney flared jean - luckily she kept hold of them! The wide leg can be intimidating, especially if you're on the shorter side. But the key is all in the shoe. Huge amounts of fabric is hard to look flattering but if you keep your heels high and your top half simple you can pull it off with confidence. A high heeled shoe with an exposed top of foot will elongate the leg, a must when wearing a cropped voluminous trouser. Louise and Emma say to avoid being drowned by too much fabric try a high heeled shoe . Louise recommends pairing a wide-leg with a simple knit to keep the outfit in proportion . If going for a longer length go high-waisted and very long to give extra leg length. Proportion is everything, team with a simple knit, shirt or tee to keep the look current and cool, not costume. Denim is the easiest way to nail the trend - Gucci revisited the Seventies with a collection filled with flared jeans in vintage washes. The stylish pair agree that denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend . The wide-leg trouser made an appearance on several catwalks including on the runway of Gucci SS15 who showcased a denim take on the trend, for a high street take try the Topshop Miller jean (right) Celine showcased colourful billowing bottoms on their SS15 runway . Topshop meanwhile have been quick to follow suit with their version - the Miller - a 1970s-style wide leg flare. Celine and Stella McCartney kept it classy with a dressier-style pant, perfect for an evening look. Try new online label Finery London for a similar style with a lower price tag.

The issue of stop rules will gain even more interest since the first HCV protease inhibitors have been approved.

I own them, and watch them every few months. I lend them to co-workers and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality Japanese film making. I think Takashi Shimizu created a great story, and presented it very effectively in these four installments.I was somewhat excited about The Grudge 2 opening in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before watching the four originals. The Grudge was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better, but I got a good Halloween scare from the 2004 American Grudge.The Grudge 2 started off badly, and went down from there. I kept waiting for it to get better, to make sense, to show Shimizu's talent - nothing like this happened. The thing that's great about Shimizu's Ju-on work is the story. True, it's usually told in a disjointed style that you have to think about to connect its components, but it is still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care about.The editing was atrocious. Disjointed (as in the Japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of scene sequence was exhausting. I just kept thinking, \"This is so stupid,\" and, \"No - he didn't really sell out this much did he??\" It made me want to walk out of the theater, run home, and watch the original work, simply to reassure myself that Shimizu has not always made this dumbed-down, generic, boring, non-sensical, thrown-together tripe.If you really have your heart set on seeing this movie, I suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people in the theater with me walked out about 45 minutes into it. I debated on whether to do that myself. Going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that point.I am truly shocked at how bad this movie was.

Beheluli, who proudly posted a picture of himself on Twitter flaunting 250,000 in cash, was part of a gang that enjoyed \"living the high life\" from their drug-related criminal activities. Authorities have stated that Beheluli frequently posted images of himself on social media, showcasing luxury vehicles, designer clothes, and expensive vacations. In one instance, he claimed to have appeared on Channel 4 dating show, My Little Princess. In addition to Beheluli's sentence, four other men involved in the drug operation have also been jailed for a total of 44 years. The arrests were part of a meticulously planned police operation by detectives from Scotland Yard's Organized Crime Command. The police discovered large quantities of high-purity cocaine and heroin hidden in an apartment in North-West London, which the gang had been using as their base. Detective Inspector Andy Durham from Scotland Yard commented on the case, saying, \"This was not a group of misguided youths dabbling in drugs, they were sophisticated organised criminals who sought to make money from death.\" Durham added, \"Beheluli was a key player within this drugs network and freely advertised his ostentatious lifestyle on social media in the hope it would make him untouchable to law enforcement agencies. He has been proven wrong.\" The police operation revealed that the gang had a unique way of packaging and transporting the drugs to minimize chances of detection. They used a vacuum packaging device to wrap the drugs in an airtight and waterproof fashion. This allowed them to secrete the drugs underwater to evade sniffer dogs while they crossed police drug checkpoints. The arrested men's social media activity, including Beheluli's, is believed to have played a significant role in the investigation and their eventual arrests, serving as proof of their expensive lifestyles funded through criminal activities.", "Yes, plasticity in relative growth rate after a reduction in nitrogen availability is related to root morphological and physiological responses. When plants experience reduced nitrogen availability, they tend to exhibit plasticity in their growth rates and make adjustments to their root systems to cope with the change. Root morphological responses to nitrogen reduction can include increased root length, increased root branching, and the development of root hairs that help the plant access more soil and potentially access more nitrogen. These morphological changes result in a greater root surface area that maximizes nutrient uptake and helps maintain plant growth even when nitrogen availability is low. Root physiological responses to reduced nitrogen availability often involve changes in root metabolic processes, nutrient transporters, and other processes that promote efficient nitrogen uptake. The plasticity in growth rate consists of increased nitrogen use efficiency, which can be achieved by modifying the expression of nitrogen transporter genes, enhancing root metabolic efficiency, and changing nitrogen assimilation pathways. In conclusion, plasticity in relative growth rate after a reduction in nitrogen availability is related to root morphological and physiological responses, as plants adjust their root systems and physiological processes to maximize nutrient uptake and maintain optimal growth in the face of limited nitrogen resources.", "Queens Park Rangers Cruise to 4-1 Victory Over Baggies, Boosting Confidence for Relegation Battle Queens Park Rangers have struck a major win in their bid to avoid Premier League relegation by scoring a thumping 4-1 victory over the Baggies.

QPR, currently sitting in the relegation zone, knew that each game from here on out would be crucial to their top-flight survival. However, few could have predicted the manner in which they dispatched the Baggies. With four goals and a convincing win under their belt, it seems the Rangers may be hitting form at just the right time, giving hope to their fans and players alike that they can indeed secure their place in the Premier League. Barton, who has seen his share of ups and downs in the league, is adamant that this victory over the Baggies will have a profound effect on the mindset of the QPR squad, stating, \"This win can definitely be a turning point for us.

Similarly, the flowering shoot arises directly from the undifferentiated endophyte. These filaments produce a protocorm in which a shoot apex originates endogenously by formation of a secondary morphological surface. This degree of modification to the vegetative body is exceptional within angiosperms and warrants additional investigation.

Juran, has a captivating premise with a prehistoric praying mantis awakened from its icy slumber ready to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting world. The movie excels in its depiction of the deadly mantis, utilizing impressive (for the time) special effects that manage to retain a nostalgic charm while conveying the creatures' destructive capabilities. The filmmakers' decision to use the concept of 'less is more' truly helps in building tension and anticipation, as the audience is left to imagine the size and threat of the monster before it is ultimately revealed. The ensemble cast, led by Craig Stevens, William Hopper, and Alix Talton, turn in engaging performances, managing to craft believable and likeable characters who are easy to root for. The subtle humor and banter between the characters provides moments of levity and adds a human touch amidst the terror caused by the menacing mantis. The plot, while somewhat formulaic, is fast-paced and entertaining, providing ample action and suspense to keep viewers glued to their seats. The film's climactic battle between the military and the deadly mantis is both thrilling and satisfying, showcasing the resilience of humanity in the face of adversity. In conclusion, THE DEADLY MANTIS achieves what it sets out to do - provide a fun and thrilling sci-fi adventure that transports its audience to a world where giant monsters roam and humanity must adapt to survive. While it may not be the most terrifying entry in the realm of sci-fi creature features, it still stands as a well-produced and entertaining classic, worthy of a watch for fans of the genre.", "Headline: Cardiff Construction Worker's Hand Reattached After Striking Accident with Electric Cutter Cardiff, Wales - A construction worker in Cardiff has miraculously returned to work after having his hand successfully reattached by surgeons following a horrific accident on site.

Despite having a seemingly promising premise and a talented cast, \"Disappointment: The Film\" ultimately fails to deliver on all fronts. The plot meanders all over the place, getting increasingly convoluted with each passing scene. It's practically impossible to pinpoint what the film's true purpose is or what message it's trying to send to the audience. The writing is perhaps the weakest link in this chain of mediocrity. Characters are one-dimensional and have barely any development throughout the film, leaving the talented actors to grapple with dialogue that seems to have been pulled together from a series of cliches and tired tropes. Speaking of the actors, their performances are shockingly subpar - which can only be attributed to poor directing, given their prowess in the industry. Visually, the movie doesn't fare much better. The cinematography is jarring and inconsistent, often pulling focus away from the action on screen. The editing leaves much to be desired, with scenes cut together haphazardly, and often ruining any sense of pacing or flow. It's evident that there was once a spark of potential within \"Disappointment: The Film,\" but whatever that spark may have been, it quickly fizzles out under the weight of its own inadequacies. Save yourself the time and frustration, and skip this one.", "Subtitle: Former Laundry Worker Discovered with a Staggering Amount of Stolen Clothing Police officers in Norwich found themselves in an unexpected situation when they discovered a 'clothing warehouse' worth over 5,000 in the home of a 67-year-old woman. Christine Carriage, who had a previous career working in a community laundry service, was caught stashing stolen clothes in her home, totalling a value of 5,620. Upon entering her property, officers were astounded by the sheer volume of clothing, stating it looked more like a warehouse than a dwelling. The discovery led to a trial held at Norwich Crown Court, where Carriage was handed a six-month suspended sentence for her crime. It was revealed that the recovered clothing contained items from multiple suppliers and that the woman had a history of minor thefts. Carriage's motivation for stealing and hoarding the items remains unclear. The judge presiding over the case acknowledged her age and lack of significant criminal history while determining her sentence, but also emphasized the severity of her actions. With the stolen goods now returned to their rightful owners, Christine Carriage will be expected to stay out of trouble for her six-month suspended sentence.", "While I am an AI language model and cannot conduct a case-cohort study, the scientific literature suggests that increased severity of mitral regurgitation is often associated with increased risk and adverse outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including those with NYHA class II heart failure. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of significant mitral regurgitation contributes to the adverse outcomes and progression of CHF. Mitral regurgitation, an abnormal leaking of blood through the mitral valve in the heart, can exacerbate heart failure symptoms, increase hospitalizations, and escalate mortality rates. In patients with systolic heart failure, mitral regurgitation contributes to a vicious cycle that further impairs the left ventricular function, leading to worsened cardiac performance and elevated morbidity and mortality risks. As the severity of mitral regurgitation increases, it puts a greater strain on the heart and may accelerate the worsening of CHF. To better understand the association between unitary increase in mitral regurgitation size and heart failure progression, particularly in NYHA class II CHF patients, a well-designed case-cohort study is necessary. Such a study could provide valuable insights into the potential risks and underscore the importance of monitoring and managing mitral regurgitation in patients with CHF. In conclusion, based on the existing scientific literature, the risk of worsening CHF appears to be positively related to the increase in mitral regurgitation size. However, a case-cohort study specifically examining a population of NYHA class II CHF patients is needed to provide more conclusive evidence on the relationship between unitary increase in mitral regurgitation and worsening CHF.", "beta-arr2 mice had significantly lower total body BMD, trabecular bone volume fraction (BVTV), and femoral cross-sectional area compared with WT. In WT females, PTH increased total body BMD, trabecular bone parameters, and cortical thickness, with a trend toward decreased midfemoral medullary area. In beta-arr2 mice, PTH not only improved total body BMD, trabecular bone architecture, and cortical thickness, but also dose-dependently increased femoral cross-sectional area and medullary area. Histomorphometry showed that PTH-stimulated periosteal bone formation was 2-fold higher in beta-arr2 compared with WT. Osteocalcin levels were significantly lower in beta-arr2 mice, but increased dose-dependently with PTH in both beta-arr2 and WT. In contrast, whereas the resorption marker TRACP5B increased dose-dependently in WT, 20-80 mugkgday of PTH was equipotent with regard to stimulation of TRACP5B in beta-arr2 . In summary, beta-arrestin2 plays an important role in bone mass acquisition and remodeling. In estrogen-replete female mice, the ability of intermittent PTH to stimulate periosteal bone apposition and endosteal resorption is inhibited by arrestins. We therefore infer that arrestin-mediated regulation of intracellular signaling contributes to the differential effects of PTH on cancellous and cortical bone.", "Tokyo (CNN) A bizarre and alarming discovery is raising concerns in Japan about the potential for terrorism involving drones. A drone carrying traces of a radioactive material was found on the rooftop of Japan's equivalent to the White House on Wednesday, police and government officials said. The discovery came on the same day a Japanese court approved a government plan to restart two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima prefecture, more than four years after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to restart the reactors is unpopular among many Japanese, who view nuclear energy as too dangerous. A staff member spotted the drone Wednesday morning on the roof of Abe's residence, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. Dozens of police investigators were dispatched to the roof to investigate the origin of the drone, which had four propeller and was 50 centimeters (20 inches) wide. Police say the drone was equipped with a small camera, smoke flares and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material believed to be cesium, a common byproduct of nuclear reactors. Cesium was also discovered in areas around the failed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after its 2011 meltdown. Investigators suspect the cesium was placed in the bottle. The amount inside is not immediately harmful to humans. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the discovery is raising concerns about terrorism. \"There might be terrorism attempts in the future at the Olympics and G7 Summit using drones,\" Suga said. \"So we need to examine and review continuously the way small unmanned vehicles like drones should be operated and how to cope with the threat of terrorism from drones. The government will do all that we can to prevent terrorism.\" Japanese law restricts drone flights around airports to prevent problems with aircraft, but there are no flight restrictions for most of Tokyo, including the Prime Minister's residence and local and federal government buildings. Abe was not in his office at the time. He is in Indonesia, attending the Asian-African Conference.

During an exclusive interview, Eriksson expressed his disappointment with the performance of his former club, saying, \"A team with this quality should be competing for the top spot. There is no reason this squad should not be winning the Premier League.\" The ex-England manager led the club for one season in 2007-2008, finishing ninth in the Premier League. However, despite Eriksson's comments, the Citizens have had a successful run since his departure, winning the league title on two occasions, in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 seasons. The 69-year-old Swede believes that Pep Guardiola's squad has the talent and depth to make a significant impact, but the team seems to be falling short of their full potential. Eriksson feels that the English top-flight has become more competitive, resulting in a tougher challenge for Manchester City to claim the top spot. In other news related to Manchester City, midfielder Yaya Toure caused a stir among fans and critics this week when he was seen wearing a snood during a training session. This event took place during the hottest week of the year so far, raising concerns about the player's wellbeing and fitness.

To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The finale is genuine and original.After seeing \"Don't Torture a Duckling\" you really have to wonder how Fulci's later stuff got so off beat. I like all his stuff, but he strayed. Maybe he figured he already did it...Because with this film, he hits the bullseye.I'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento owns the giallo genre.

Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables sent two days before the crash, Germany failed to pass on the warning, local media reported. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17, and all 298 aboard were killed. Warning: Despite being told of the risk of flying over Ukraine in diplomatic cables two days before the MH17 crash, the German government failed to pass on the warning . German foreign ministry cables sent on July 15, cited an incident from the day before when a Ukrainian air force plane was shot down at around 20,000 feet over rebel-held territory. German intelligence had repeatedly warned of the risk to aviation security, and had assessed the downing of the Ukrainian military plane on July 14 as a 'significant development because of its altitude', German public TV channels NDR and WDR and Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. Earlier this month, the Dutch government - which lost 189 citizens in the disaster - said that, with nearly all of the victims identified, efforts had shifted . to finding those responsible for shooting the plane down as it flew over Ukraine last July. After a meeting of foreign ministers from Malaysia, Ukraine and Australia on the . sidelines of a cyber-security conference in The Hague, Holland's Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said there was general agreement on this course of action.

Well, \"Into the Unknown\" certainly embodies that sentiment in a thrilling, suspenseful, and ultimately satisfying manner. This psychological horror film centers around protagonist Anna (played brilliantly by Jane Doe), an inquisitive woman who just can't help but poke her nose into the secrets of her seemingly mundane suburban town. From start to finish, \"Into the Unknown\" keeps you on the edge of your seat, as Anna stumbles upon a series of ominous events and bizarre occurrences with potentially devastating consequences. Supported by a stellar supporting cast, Anna's slow descent into the town's dark underbelly is both captivating and chilling. Director John Smith showcases some truly haunting visuals juxtaposed against the cheerful demeanor of the town, creating a sense of unease that lingers long after the credits roll. The screenplay, penned by Karen Johnson, is equally as impressive, with snappy dialogue and well-crafted characters that feel all too real, making their deeds even more terrifying. Television horror can often fall into the trap of relying on cheap thrills and worn-out horror cliches, but \"Into the Unknown\" deftly avoids these pitfalls. The build-up is masterful, expertly weaving suspense and dread throughout the narrative, which leads to a gut-wrenching climax that will leave audiences reeling. \"Into the Unknown\" proves that satisfying horror stories can indeed be found on the small screen.

This tends to consistently derail the sense of wonder and immersion that could have been achieved. Aside from this frustrating narrative choice, the movie does boast stunning visuals that manage to evoke a sense of vastness and awe for the uncharted territories. The performances are solid, with the lead actors delivering emotionally-charged scenes that make us care about their well-being amidst the chaos surrounding their explorations. The score is a carefully crafted accompaniment to the visuals, often providing the emotional weight that the forced suspense does not. It shifts between ambition, tension, and melancholy, matching elegantly with the trials and tribulations faced by the characters. Unfortunately, the artificial sense of drama created by the aforementioned distractions ultimately serves as a disservice to the film, often negating the excellent work put forth by the cast, the visual department, and the score. One cannot help but hope for a more nuanced approach to storytelling that keeps the viewer engaged without resorting to cheap tricks.

In addition to Henderson and Wilshere, Manchester City also maintains an interest in Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling. The talented young player has been on City's radar for some time and would further enhance the team's attacking options. In conclusion, Manchester City are prioritising the inclusion of more English players in their lineup for next season. With Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere, and Raheem Sterling all on their wishlist, it remains to be seen how these transfers will unfold in the coming months.", "Lesion of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway can lead to a variety of motor and sensory symptoms, but there is not much evidence directly linking it to the induction of trigeminal dynamic mechanical allodynia. Trigeminal dynamic mechanical allodynia refers to a painful sensation in the area innervated by the trigeminal nerve in response to a normally non-painful stimulus. Multiple neural pathways are involved in pain processing, including dopaminergic pathways, but lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway is more commonly associated with Parkinson's disease and motor symptoms rather than the specific induction of trigeminal allodynia. However, research on the relationship between dopaminergic pathways and pain processing is still ongoing; hence, a definitive answer is yet to be established. It is important to remember that pain, including trigeminal allodynia, is a complex and multifactorial experience, with various mechanisms and pathways potentially interacting and contributing to the development of painful symptoms.", "Prepregnancy LBP predicts renewed pain during pregnancy, and dysfunction of back muscles has been established in LBP. In this study, disturbance in the relaxation of the back muscles was linearly related to current, and also to later, pain scores. In addition, back muscle activity level was inversely related to the disability index. For the first time, it has been shown prospectively that the function pattern of back extensors seems to predict, and is related to, future back pain. Simple function testing is promising and might be valuable in identifying mothers with a high risk of pregnancy-related back pain and in directing preventive intervention to high risk women by making them aware of self-treatment methods.", "Person1: It depends on where you are and what position you are in.

Subjects with inner ear malformations, especially Mondini's dysplasia, need to be carefully evaluated pre-operatively to reduce or eliminate any anatomical conditions which may predispose to meningitis. In children with an auditory brainstem implant and suspected ear malformation, we recommend pre-operative radiological investigation to look for the 'bulging oval window' sign. When radiological signs are positive, bilateral exploratory tympanotomy should be performed to detect any undiagnosed anatomical stapes footplate defects, which may predispose to bacterial meningitis.", "Yes, the L1-type cell adhesion molecule Neuroglian is necessary for maintenance of sensory axon advance in the Drosophila embryo. Studies have shown that neuroglian, a homolog of the vertebrate L1 family of cell adhesion molecules, is involved in the development of sensory axons, especially their growth cones, and the formation of the sensory nervous system in Drosophila embryos. Mutations or disruptions in neuroglian can lead to defects in sensory axon pathfinding, growth and guidance, and thus may result in abnormal or impaired sensory neuron development.", "Person1: Excuse me.

Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws, The Courier-Mail reports. Mr Morris says he wasn't driving when his Volvo was photographed doing 57kmh in a 50kmh zone last year. But he won't say who was behind the wheel. He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817, arguing it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver. Scroll down for video . Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws . He says he was in a meeting with top judges when the Volvo was snapped, and they are willing to testify that he was with them. He argues the spousal privilege principle, established in England 200 years ago, means a husband can't be compelled to provide information that incriminates his wife. 'I decline to identify the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the relevant time,' Mr Morris reportedly wrote in a letter to the Department of Transport. Earlier this year, Mr Morris wrote to federal, state and territory attorneys-general saying he planned to challenge parts of Queensland's speed-camera laws. Mr Morris is trying to avoid a 146 speeding fine in Queensland . Mr Morris argues the spousal privilege principle, established in England 200 years ago, means a husband can't be compelled to provide information that incriminates his wife . Car owners can't, under the law, say they know who the driver was but refuse to give a name . Under the laws, the registered owner of a car has two options: name the driver or say they don't know who was driving. Car owners can't, under the law, say they know who the driver was but refuse to give a name. Mr Morris has told The Courier-Mail he can't see why he should dob someone in for driving the car when the legislation is invalid. He said the Volvo caught by the speed camera was not his usual car, but would not tell the paper who usually drove it. The case will go to the Court of Appeal within weeks.", "Person1: I got an internship offer at a really great company today! Person2: That's fantastic, honey! Tell me more about it.", "Interferon (IFN and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) are both known to be involved in various processes related to tissue repair, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, their specific roles in adhesion formation after partial hepatectomy are not well-defined. IFN- is a cytokine that is involved in immunomodulatory and antiviral responses. It has been shown to play a role in tissue repair and liver regeneration after injury. For example, IFN- has been suggested to regulate the activation of hepatic stellate cells, which are involved in the process of liver fibrosis and adhesion formation. Additionally, IFN- has been reported to have anti-fibrotic properties, potentially reducing adhesion and scar formation after injury. PAI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates fibrinolysis, the process of breaking down fibrin clots. PAI-1 is involved in wound healing, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis. It has been demonstrated that elevated PAI-1 levels lead to increased fibrosis and adhesion formation in various tissues, including the liver. While both IFN- and PAI-1 are known to be involved in processes related to adhesion formation, further studies are needed to clarify their specific roles in this process after partial hepatectomy.", "Yes, the demonstration of CDX2 can be highly antibody-dependent. CDX2 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells. It is often used as a marker for gastrointestinal origin in the context of cancer diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a common laboratory technique used to detect CDX2 expression, and it relies on specific antibodies to bind and visualize the protein. The sensitivity and specificity of CDX2 detection can depend on the quality and performance of the antibodies used in the IHC technique. Identifying suitable antibodies with high affinity and specificity for the target antigen (CDX2) is crucial for accurate results.", "Yes, acidosis can induce reprogramming of cellular metabolism to mitigate oxidative stress. Acidosis is a condition in which the pH level of the body's fluids and tissues becomes overly acidic. This can occur due to various reasons such as the production of excessive amounts of metabolic acids, kidney dysfunction, or respiratory disorders. Acidosis has been linked to multiple cellular alterations that may lead to changes in cellular metabolism. For instance, it has been shown that acidosis can induce a switch from aerobic respiration to glycolysis, which may help to reduce oxidative stress. Glycolysis is a less efficient but anaerobic metabolic pathway that does not rely on oxygen and reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are responsible for oxidative stress. In addition to metabolic changes, acidosis may also help mitigate oxidative stress by activating several cytoprotective pathways and promoting the expression of antioxidant enzymes. These changes can help in neutralizing ROS and protecting cells from oxidative damage. In conclusion, acidosis can induce reprogramming of cellular metabolism and various cellular adaptations to mitigate oxidative stress. However, it is important to note that persistent acidosis may have detrimental effects on overall cellular function and can contribute to the progression of various diseases.", "Yes, endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in brain blood vessels is nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide is a molecule produced by the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, and it functions as a vasodilator, meaning it helps relax and widen blood vessels. This increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure.", "Yes, disc arthroplasty design can influence intervertebral kinematics and facet forces. Disc arthroplasty, also known as artificial disc replacement, is a surgical procedure that aims to restore the normal motion and function of the intervertebral disc by replacing it with a prosthetic device. The design of the artificial disc plays a significant role in determining its performance and interaction with the surrounding soft tissues and bony structures, such as the facet joints. The design parameters, such as the dimensions, material properties, shape, and articulation of the artificial disc, can affect the kinematics and biomechanics of the spine. Studies have shown that different designs may lead to variations in the range of motion, segmental stability, load distribution, and force transmission through the facet joints. For instance, a more conforming disc design, which closely mimics the natural shape and movement of the intervertebral disc, may provide better motion preservation and more uniform load distribution across the endplates and facets. In contrast, a non-conforming or flat design may result in a higher concentration of forces on the facet joints, potentially increasing the risk of facet joint degeneration and pain. Furthermore, the choice of materials used in the disc arthroplasty can impact the wear properties, stress distribution, and longevity of the implant. The selection of an appropriate material can help minimize the wear debris and inflammatory reactions, thus maintaining the optimal biomechanics and kinematics of the spine. In conclusion, the design of disc arthroplasty significantly influences intervertebral kinematics and facet forces. Proper design considerations are crucial to ensure appropriate motion preservation, segmental stability, and load distribution in the implanted spine segment.", "Person1: 17-year bird calls?

Tobacco smoke is known to cause DNA damage, leading to the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. One early event in the DDR pathway is the phosphorylation of H2AX (forming -H2AX), which marks the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. ATM is an important kinase involved in the DDR pathway, and its activation is often observed along with histone H2AX phosphorylation after exposure to genotoxic agents, such as tobacco smoke. Several studies have reported an increase in both ATM activation and -H2AX levels in A549 cells (a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line) after tobacco smoke exposure.", "This movie starts out great, and sucks you in. Most acting is good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang- everyone else sounds British-like even the Muslim) shows up, and proves that he can't act.

There's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex. To keep from screaming with boredom, you clutch at the minimal story line - and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic. It's like someone took several half-baked B movies and tossed them in a blender.What comes out is mostly a film about meaninglessness - and not a good one.

Three players were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease this week, including Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero. Players have been forced to use insect repellent during practice sessions and clubs have asked health officials to check their training centres for mosquito breeding sites. Brazilian football clubs have been put on alert after a dengue fever outbreak . In addition to Guerrero, Palmeiras reserve goalkeeper Aranha and young Santos striker Leo Cittadini also have been diagnosed with the disease and won't be able to help their teams in the final stages of the Sao Paulo state championship this month. 'We have to find a way to stay away from this little mosquito,' Palmeiras midfielder Arouca said. Guerrero, Corinthians' top striker, will also miss his team's last two games in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores, Latin America's top club tournament. The Peruvian has been hospitalized since Saturday and there is no word on when he will be released. Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero is one of three players that have already been diagnosed . The players affected will need about two weeks to fully recover from the disease, which causes extreme joint pain and headaches. There is no cure, but is rarely fatal. Cases of dengue fever have increased significantly across Brazil this year, with most of them reported in Sao Paulo state. Brazil's health ministry said there have been more than 460,000 cases of the disease in the country in 2015, which accounts for almost 5,000 cases a day. More than 130 people have died so far this year, the ministry said. Corinthians midfielder Renato Augusto said some players have been practicing with pants and long sleeves to try to avoid the mosquitoes. 'We are afraid, of course,' he said. 'It turns out it's not only the defenders we have to worry about these days.' Guerrero, who used to play for Bayern Munich, in action for Corinthians in a Copa Libertadores match . Another Corinthians player, defender Rodrigo Sam, was hospitalized for two weeks after getting the disease earlier this year. Health officials inspected Corinthians' training center this week and said there were no signs of breeding sites for mosquitoes carrying dengue. The popular Brazilian club said the players were likely infected while away from the team's premises. Still, doctor Ivan Grava said players would continue to use insect repellent and, when possible, the team would not practice during times mosquitoes were more likely to appear. Another top Brazilian club affected by dengue fever this year was Sao Paulo. One of the team's doctors had the disease, and players recently expressed their concern about having to play a match in a city where the disease had spread quickly.", "Yes, characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers can reveal novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes. By examining such a large and diverse sample set, researchers can identify common molecular patterns and subtypes among the cancers, leading to more targeted and effective therapies. Molecular subtyping classifies tumors based on their distinct molecular features rather than their histology. This approach has proven to be highly useful in better understanding the biology and clinical outcomes of various cancer types, including breast, lung, and colon cancers, and has led to improved clinical decision-making. In the case of prostate cancer, molecular subtyping could lead to the identification of new biological pathways and mechanisms underlying tumor progression, which may be potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, molecular subtypes can give insights into the aggressiveness of the tumor and its propensity to metastasize, helping to better predict patient prognosis and informing decisions when it comes to treatment options. In conclusion, characterizing a large set of primary prostate cancers could indeed reveal novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes, enabling more personalized and effective cancer treatment.", "Person1: Excuse me, Alice, I've never used this place before.

Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival in what he claims was an attempt to help Tasmanians take advantage of its grand heritage. He decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent. Mr Schofield said he was offered 300,000 for the 2014 festival which was a reduction from the 400,000 the government offered in the previous year. 'We were deeply wounded and shocked,' he said. The festival] was supported by a lot of wonderful people down there, who shared the vision that the government wouldn't. Anyhow, we threw up our hands and said, 'We're not going to do it anymore. Fk you.' Mr Schofield moved to Hobart to set up a Baroque music festival, but decided to relocate back to New South Wales after the Tasmanian Government cut the festivals funding by 25 per cent . After receiving an offer from Queensland arts organisations he decided to move the festival to Brisbane. Mr Schofield said his daughters recognised that the battle he was waging with the Tasmanian Government took a toll on him and decided to stage an 'intervention'. 'The whole process knocked me about terribly and I honestly started going to pieces,' he said. 'I was drinking, I was taking a lot of tablets, and stupidly driving when I was in no condition to drive. I was suffering from acute depression.'

He tweeted: 'No one cut his funding, he asked for more and spat the dummy when it wasn't given'.", "Lesioned animals presented significant DMA in the orofacial area that occurred from 4 days to 5 weeks post-injury. To investigate a segmental implication in the neuropathic pain induced by dopamine depletion, the expression of the isoform gamma of the protein kinase C (PKCg) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 12 (pERK12) was explored in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH). There was a high increase in PKCg expression in the III and IIi laminae of the MDH of lesioned-animals compared to shams. pERK12 expression was also significantly high in the ipsilateral MDH of lesioned rats in response to non-noxious tactile stimulus of the orofacial region. Since pERK12 is expressed only in response to nociceptive stimuli in the dorsal spinal horn, the current study demonstrates that non-noxious stimuli evoke allodynic response. Intraperitoneal and intracisternal administrations of bromocriptine, a dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) agonist, significantly decreased DMA compared to control rats injected with saline. These data demonstrate for the first time that nigrostriatal dopaminergic depletion produces trigeminal neuropathic pain that at least involves a segmental mechanism. In addition, bromocriptine was shown to have a remarkable analgesic effect on this neuropathic pain symptom.", "Person1: Sorry to bother you.

The Japan international, who has played for the J-League side since 2013, will join Chelsea's Dutch partner club Vitesse Arnhem on loan next season if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Ogane claims that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not connected to the 200million sponsorship deal they signed with Japanese company Yokohama Rubber in February. FC Tokyo forwardYoshinori Muto (centre) brings the ball forward againstAlbirex Niigata in March . FC Tokyo presidentNaoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid for Japan international Muto .

International goals:1 . Did you know? Muto graduated fromKeio University in Tokyo with an economics degree two weeks ago . Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said:'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto. 'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.' Muto, whoonly graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, would be the first Japanese player to represent Chelsea if he moves to west London. He has earned 11 caps for his country after signing his first professional contract in 2014, scoring once for the Samurai Blue. A 4million deal for the youngster has been mooted, but Muto admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid. He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.' Muto scored 13 times in his debut season with FC Tokyo and was named in the J-League's best XI.

The Texan's dramatic victory over fellow-American Matt Kuchar demonstrates his return to form following a difficult 2016 campaign. As the Premier League season comes to a nail-biting climax, Manchester City and Liverpool are set to battle it out for the final Champions League spot. While City appears poised to maintain their position, a late surge from Liverpool could change the dynamics drastically, sealing the Reds' return to Europe's premier club competition.", "Yes, high intracellular trehalase activity can prevent the storage of trehalose in the yeast Dekkera bruxellensis. Trehalase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes trehalose into two glucose molecules.

Hakeem Kuta, 17, reportedly misjudged a ledge while backing away from police officers who were responding to a complaint in the lobby of a building on Valentine Avenue. According to the police, officers were responding to complaints of a group of teenagers smoking marijuana and loitering in the building's lobby. When the officers approached, Kuta is said to have tried to distance himself from the group by stepping back, but appears to have misjudged a ledge and fell, suffering injuries. Kuta had been listed in critical condition in St. Barnabas Hospital since the incident but tragically passed away on Saturday morning. This tragic accident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers involved when police officers and citizens interact in high-stress situations, while at the same time highlights the importance of taking caution and exercising good judgement in these circumstances.", "Don't pay any attention to the rave reviews of this film here. It is the worst Van Damme film and one of the worst of any sort I have ever seen. It would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than gunfire and explosions to be entertained.Seeing that this is directed by Peter Hyams it has made me realise that Peter has no talent as a director, but is very good at filming explosions and the like. However, movies need other elements as well; for example, a story. This one didn't have one. This might explain the awfulness of some of Mr. Hyams' more recent films, hardly any better than this one, really.One can't help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera.", "LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good film, though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films. This French masterpiece, directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, showcases a riveting criminal saga with a brilliant ensemble cast. The story follows a group of criminals who band together to execute a high-stakes heist. As tensions escalate, the members of the crew grapple with trust, loyalty, and betrayal. Although the plot may remind viewers of previous heist films, Melville's direction and the nuanced performances by Alain Delon, Gian Maria Volonte, and Yves Montand make it a standout in the heist genre. Furthermore, the movie masterfully employs cinematography and pacing to create a sense of menace and unease. The bleak, urban landscapes and muted color palette add to the film's overall atmosphere of dread and tension. It clearly displays Melville's affinity for American gangster and noir films while infusing it with a singular French touch. However, the movie's similarities to other heist films cannot be ignored. Some viewers may find the story formulaic, even with Melville's distinctive cinematic prowess. Also, some elements of the film's climax may seem familiar for those well-versed in the genre, undermining the intended tension. Nonetheless, LE CERCLE ROUGE remains an engaging and captivating watch. The performances, direction, and atmosphere make it a well-crafted and memorable film that deserves to be recognized alongside its fellow crime classics. Those who appreciate the genre should not miss out on this gripping and stylish piece of French cinema.", "It has been shown that the government began to take part when it was convinced that an organ procurement program from BDDs is not a luxury program but can lessen the economic burden on the health budget and be supported by legislations and budget allocation. Professionals took the responsibility not only to make decision makers and the public aware of the subject and adapt the national protocols to consider the general population concerns, but also to train as many medical teams as possible nationwide. Persistence and publishing the results can pave the way for the public to accept the program and take their own responsibilities to solve the problem of organ shortage by taking the opportunity to give life to others after the death of a loved one.", "Farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything the show attempts, it does very well. From a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show. The special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv. The acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the American market of actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said, wow where did that Agent Smith come from? Its the same feeling that you get watching Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Aussies are great and it comes through in this great show.The plot is second to none. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes, but this tops even that. Its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed. The overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. I am always itching for the next show.The comedic episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching, and the action sequences are tense. The beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud, something that rarely happens while watching television that is not South Park, Sealab 2021, or Seinfeld. The drama is even harder, whether Crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality, all is done with heart and intensity. Lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops. This is sci-fi.If you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest, if you enjoy good television at all, if you like good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch Farscape.Oh, and Ben Browder owns.", "To our knowledge, this is the first large study of animal mitochondrial diversity using actual census population sizes and the first to test outliers for population structure.

They also discuss how it has influenced art, architecture, and politics in different regions. Person1: It seems like a comprehensive program. I must admit, I don't know much about Islam, but I'd like to learn so I can better understand it. Can I join you? Person2: Of course! The more, the merrier. They just started discussing the Five Pillars of Islam. We can watch it together and learn at the same time. Person1: Great, thanks! Is this program part of a series or is it a standalone episode? Person2: This is the first episode in a series. They plan to explore various aspects of Islam in more depth in future episodes. I think it's important to understand different cultures and religions so that we can be more open-minded and respectful. Person1: I completely agree. Understanding other people's beliefs and traditions can help bridge gaps and foster coexistence. What channel is this on? I might want to record the series and watch it later. Person2: It's on the History Channel. They usually have some great educational programs. I can help you set up the recording if you want. Person1: That would be great, thanks!

Ben Powers played the character of Thelma's husband Keith in the show's sixth and final season between . He passed away at his New Bedford, Massachusetts home on April 6 at the age of 64. His family has not revealed the cause of his death. Powers' on-screen wife Bern Nadette Stanis wrote an emotion message on Facebook on Thursday to mark the actor's death. Actor Ben Powers (left) died April 6 at the age of 64. He is best known for his part on the CBS sitcom Good Times, playing the husband of main character Thelma (right, played by Bern Nadette Stanis) 'My condolences goes out to the family of Ben Powers who past a few days ago. He was a great actor and great friend who is gone too soon. He will be missed by many. Until next lifetime my friend,' Stanis wrote. Good Times focused on the family of Florida and James Evans and their children J.J., Thelma and Michael, living in a Chicago housing project. The show was a spin-off of another series, Maude, which was also spin-off of All In The Family. In the third episode of the final season, Thelma gets married to a professional football player named Keith (played by Powers) but their marriage runs into problems when he gets injured. Powers was born in Brooklyn and raised by his grandparents in Providence, Rhode Island. Before getting into acting, he studied painting and sketching at the Rhode Island School of Design. He was discovered while performing stand-up routines in Providence. In addition to his work on Good Times, Powers also played the character of Moochie on CBS detective drama Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer between 1984 and 1985. He also had guest appearances on shows like Gimme a Break, Flamingo Road, The Greatest American Hero and Laverne Shirley. Some of his film credits include Cheech Chong's Next Movie in 1980, Things Are Tough All Over in 1982, and The Man Who loved Women in 1983 which starred Burt Reynolds. Powers is survived by his mother and two sisters.", "Our finding that cleavage at the B site is insensitive to homology shows that effective synapsis between partners does not depend on sequence matching. Cleavage at the B' site provides the earliest positive signal for a homology-dependent switch in the lambda recombination machinery. Because this switch can occur in the absence of strand joining, the results argue against models that invoke strand ligation as the critical element of homology-sensing. Alternative mechanisms are presented that involve varieties of non-covalent strand swapping. A synthesis of the present results and other recent experiments highlights the importance of the disannealing of complementary strands and their reannealing to new partners, a process traditionally described as branch migration. The reversibility of branch migration and its bias away from mismatched combinations are proposed to be the major mechanisms of homology-sensing during lambda integration.", "Person1: Hi, may I get you anything to drink?

This report comes as the authorities continue to search for the bodies of a reported 400 people missing after their vessel sunk off the Libyan coast, as claimed by international charity organisation, Save the Children. However, the coast guard cannot confirm these reports. On Tuesday, 144 survivors were taken to Reggio Calabria, Italy, from where Save the Children heard reports of the latest tragedy to occur on one of the most perilous migration routes in the world. The boat allegedly went down 24 hours before the group of survivors had been picked up close to a large submerged rubber boat that had reportedly capsized in the waters south of Italy. Italian Coast Guard spokesman, Cosimo Nicastro said that the Coast Guard has not yet found the missing boat, and declined to comment on any further details of the report. In the past month alone, about 6,000 people have been rescued, with a number of boats having capsized. The partial dismantling last year of the EU's naval operation was blamed for failing to prevent a rush of migrant vessels and subsequently being unable to save hundreds of lives from the deadly crossing from North Africa. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy and Greece this far into 2016 is already 80 higher than the same period in 2015. If the reports regarding the lost boat are confirmed, theIOM will be forced to increase this year's death toll to over 1,600, continuing the situation we have seen in previous years, with warmer weather leading to a significant increase in the dangers of shipwreck for thousands of migrants trying to reach Europe. The Italian Coast Guard reiterated the necessity of the current rescue services. It explained that a vast number of the migrants traveling from Libya are illegally transported on \"sub-register\" or aging vessels, which are unsuitable for any kind of voyage, much less one that requires them to travel the choppy, high risk waters of the Mediterranean.", "I wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away. But, surprisingly, \"The Haunted Hilarity\" manages to stand out among the plethora of rehashed ideas in this subgenre. The film doesn't rely solely on cheap thrills and jump scares, but rather employs a dark and twisted sense of humor to create a uniquely enjoyable viewing experience. \"The Haunted Hilarity\" takes place in a run-down haunted house which a group of ambitious but naive paranormal investigators use as a film set for their new reality TV show. However, as the filming begins, they soon realize that the house doesn't appreciate being exploited for entertainment purposes. The film's cast is an incredibly talented ensemble of both seasoned actors and fresh faces, each bringing their own unique comedic timing and delivery. The mockumentary style allows for the actors to break the fourth wall, which not only highlights their skills in improvisation but also allows for the audience to be completely immersed in their moments of wit. What sets \"The Haunted Hilarity\" apart from other horror spoofs is its ability to combine horror and humor effectively. While it does not shy away from classic horror tropes, the script takes these familiar themes and turns them on their head, often with an added element of comic relief. Visually, the film impresses with its use of practical effects and makeup, which only adds to the film's humor as the cast interacts with the absurdities they encounter on set. Moreover, the filmmakers strike an excellent balance between found-footage style and traditional cinematography, making the absurdity of the situations feel grounded and more believable to the audience. \"The Haunted Hilarity\" not only mocks the absurdity of paranormal TV shows, but also the genre of horror as a whole, while still bringing an original and refreshing sense of humor to the table. Overall, this film is a pleasant surprise among the oversaturated market of mockumentaries and horror spoofs. So, if you're in the mood for a horror movie that will make you laugh out loud while still keeping you on the edge of your seat, \"The Haunted Hilarity\" is an absolute must-watch!", "Leaving aside the drawbacks and deficiencies of the film mentioned by other viewers, I must say that it seemed to me a film about power, which is, in my opinion, one of the most luring illusions. The film delves into the complexities of the human psyche as it grapples with and is seduced by the charm of power. The main character's evolution from an earnest and ambitious individual to a manipulative and ruthless player in a power game is strikingly depicted. The intricate plot and engaging storytelling captivated my attention as I observed how every other character was drawn into this dark web of deceit, betrayal, and secrets. The cinematography, too, played a significant role in the movie, with its contrasting imagery and hues reflecting the varying power dynamics throughout the story. Additionally, the gripping performances by the lead and supporting actors only added to the film's overall allure. However, the film is not without its flaws. It suffers from occasional lulls and cliches, but the themes of power, ambition, and inevitable consequences are so vividly portrayed that I could easily overlook the imperfections. In conclusion, this film not only offers an enthralling and entertaining viewing experience but also provokes thought about the age-old question of power and its costs. Highly recommended for those interested in exploring the darker side of human nature.", "Hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years, but none stranger than this. \"Bizarre Bazaar: Maximum Weirdness\" takes eccentricity to an entirely new level with its blend of surreal visuals, outlandish storylines, and unconventional characters. Directed by the enigmatic visionary, Artemis Oddball, \"Bizarre Bazaar\" features a diverse cast led by the highly versatile Tilda Swinton, who weaves through various narratives as a shape-shifting protagonist. The film is set in an uncanny world that blurs the lines between reality and imagination, constantly subverting audience expectations. In one memorable sequence, Swinton must navigate through a dream-like flea market filled with talking animals, gravity-defying objects, and time-traveling salespeople. The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast including Tom Waits as a melancholic elephant, Helena Bonham Carter as a mermaid with an identity crisis, and Danny DeVito as an irritable fortune-telling gnome. The cinematography of \"Bizarre Bazaar\" is nothing short of breathtaking - from its kaleidoscopic visuals to its seamless blending of practical and CGI effects, the movie feels like stepping into a psychedelic painting. Moreover, the film's score by composer Hans Zimmer is an auditory symphony of oddity, perfectly elevating the peculiar atmosphere. However, \"Bizarre Bazaar\" is not without its flaws. The overarching plot is often difficult to follow, and the film's pacing sometimes falters. Furthermore, while some may appreciate its unique blend of strange allure, it might prove too bewildering for some viewers, leaving them questioning the very fabric of reality. In conclusion, \"Bizarre Bazaar: Maximum Weirdness\" is a film that celebrates the bizarre and embraces the unorthodox. It is an ambitious and visually stunning exploration into the depths of human imagination. While not for the faint of heart or those seeking a conventional cinematic experience, the movie offers a daring journey into the extraordinary world of Oddball's vision. As long as one remains open-minded, this peculiar masterpiece may turn out to be a memorable trip through the looking glass of strangeness.", "Bucks Resident Builds Remarkable Observatory in Garden, Captures Stunning Images of the Solar System Over 40 years ago, Dave Tyler, a retired engineer from Buckinghamshire, decided to take his love for astronomy to new heights by building an incredible observatory right in his garden. Sitting in a peaceful corner of his Bucks home since 1977, Tyler's custom-built observatory captures breathtaking images of the solar system, delving deep into the cosmos by zooming in on intricate details of planets, solar flares, and sunspots, among others. Tyler, who shared pictures of his observatory for the first time this week, reveals that the idea of creating the space stemmed from his intense passion for astronomy. Always enthralled by the stars and celestial bodies typically out of our reach, he set out on a journey to study deep space phenomena from the comfort of his own home. Over four decades, Tyler has continuously upgraded his observatory with the latest state-of-the-art equipment. At the heart of this impressive set up is a powerful telescope that allows him to capture mesmerizing images of our solar system, photographing everything from intricate sunspot activity to reflections on ice caps, and even massive solar flares - fiery explosions on the sun's surface that hurl enormous amounts of energy into space. According to Tyler, the complex space phenomena he captures are not only fascinating to study, but they also serve as important indicators of the sun's activity and how it affects the Earth's weather patterns. His detailed images of solar flares, for example, shed light on the immense power of the sun, making us aware of the giant star's potential to disrupt communications and satellite systems on Earth. In addition to photographing the sun's activity, Tyler's observatory allows him to study planets within the solar system, providing a unique view beyond what can be seen with the naked eye. By carefully aligning his powerful telescope with the orbits of planets such as Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter, he can capture detailed images of their ice caps and cloud belts, making him ever more aware of the beauty and complexity of our universe. Tyler's dedication to exploring and photographing the cosmos has not only made him an expert in his field but has also earned him recognition within the international astronomy community. His observatory has become a popular hub for fellow astronomy enthusiasts and researchers, who often visit to engage in discussions on the latest space discoveries and how they impact humanity's understanding of the universe. With the continued advancements in astronomical technology available for home use, Tyler's observatory stands as a testament to the limitless possibilities for amateur astronomers. As he continues to study and photograph deep space phenomena, his work serves as an inspiration to fellow stargazers and a reminder that the mysteries of the universe are well within our reach.", "It is possible for the modification of bacterial growth to occur by alloplastic bone substitute. Alloplastic bone substitutes are synthetic materials used in bone graft procedures to support and enhance bone healing and regeneration. These materials can be designed with specific properties, such as antimicrobial activity, which can modify bacterial growth and reduce the risk of infection at the implantation site. However, the exact interaction between alloplastic bone substitutes and bacterial growth would depend on the composition and properties of the specific bone substitute material used.", "Strong directional selection is expected to deplete genetic variation, yet many species show striking genetically-based polymorphisms. Most studies evoke frequency dependent selection to explain the persistence of such variation. Consistent with a growing body of evidence, our findings suggest that a complex form of balancing selection may alternatively explain the evolution and maintenance of AMSs in a colour polymorphic fish. In particular, this study demonstrates that intrasexual competition results in phenotypically distinct males exhibiting clear differences in their levels of aggression to exclude potential sexual rivals. By being dominant, the more aggressive males are able to circumvent female mating preferences for attractive males, whereas another male type incorporates subordinate behaviours that allow them to circumvent male aggression and female mating preferences. Together, these and previous results indicate that exploiting different aspects of social interactions may allow males to evolve distinct mating strategies and thus the long term maintenance of polymorphisms within populations.", "\"In this film, I prefer Deacon Frost. The movie really showcases the best of what an antagonistic character can bring to a story, with Deacon Frost being a fearsome, cunning, and ruthless opponent. The actor who plays Deacon Frost really manages to effectively immerse themselves in the role, creating a captivating performance that ultimately outshines the protagonist. The movie's plot, centering around a battle between an unlikely hero and a powerful, ancient enemy, is familiar territory, but Deacon's intriguing motives and twisted justifications add a level of depth that keeps you invested throughout. Furthermore, his sinister charm against the protagonist's more stoic demeanor only adds to his appeal to the audience. Visually, the film is a treat, with expertly choreographed action sequences that highlight the unstoppable force that Deacon is. The movie does not shy away from exploring darker, more brutal aspects of the characters, with Deacon Frost embracing his violent, bloodthirsty nature without compromising his complex characterization. The soundtrack also complements Deacon Frost's character arc, subverting expectations by using hauntingly beautiful melodies paired with the chilling acts he commits. This sets a tone that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, unsure of what heinous act Deacon will do next. Ultimately, this film might not be groundbreaking in its larger themes, but Deacon Frost's magnetic presence is reason enough to watch and enjoy it. He is a villain that stays with you, and the morally gray aspects of his character force you to question the traditional herovillain dynamic, making for an engaging and thought-provoking experience. In the end, it's Deacon Frost who undeniably steals the show and leaves us craving more.\"", "If you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future, go on and watch the movie (610). It is a nice fantasy movie with well done CGI, nice acting, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story.If you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). The story is totally different from the original book. This may explain that the movie is voted 110 from people around 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing.Most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much to the worse): - The magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (Changing weather, creating illusions, transform into animals, ...) In the movie the magic is more like \"jedi-school for the middle ages\" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil is looking like emperor palpatine (after part III) doesn't make it really better.- The mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie. In the book the story is set near Dresden, which Krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities. (This part might have been changed to cut costs.) I also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains.- The whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style. Lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. The book never suggested such an environment.- In the book the master tries to make Krabat his successor but Krabat rejects. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the movie Krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy.- The movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x. OK, the stories are missing anyway in the movie.Also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes: - In the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work. This explanation is missing in the movie. Sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy.- The book explains why only a few \"Gesellen\" try to confront the master: If the master dies by any mundane reasons, the \"Gesellen\" are free AND keep their magical powers. If the master dies at the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.", "Based on a larger phylogeny of the subfamily Murinae, we showed that significant differences in reproductive rates among colonization groups are shared with their closest relatives outside Sahul. Therefore, the lower reproductive rates in the old endemics are more likely to be the result of phylogenetic history and conservation of traits than an adaptation to the Australian environment. In the new endemics, we found a trend of increasing reproductive rates with diversification. We suggest that the differences in reproductive rates of the old endemic rodents and the native Rattus represent alternative adaptive strategies that have allowed them to utilize similar ecological niches across Australia.", "The idea behind Dead Silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. There was so much going for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest much into this. It's a dumb movie. You've been warned.", "The D187N mutation has been suggested to destabilize the structure of the gelsolin parent protein (specifically domain 2), facilitating two proteolytic cleavage events. Our studies demonstrate that generating the largely unstructured peptide is not sufficient alone for amyloid formation in vitro (on a time scale of months). A drop in pH or an analogous environmental change appears necessary to convert the unstructured fragment into amyloid fibrils, probably through an associative mechanism. The wild-type gelsolin fragment will make amyloid fibrils from pH 6 to 4 in vitro, but neither the wild-type fragment nor fibrils have been observed in vivo. It is possible that domain 2 of wild-type gelsolin is stable in the context of the whole protein and not susceptible to the proteolytic degradation that affords the 71-residue FAF-associated peptide.", "Intermedinadrenomedullin 2 (IMDADM2) is a peptide hormone that has been found to have various physiological functions, including vasodilation, regulation of hormone secretion, and cell proliferation. Previous studies have suggested a possible role for IMDADM2 in reproductive physiology, including implantation and placentation. There is some evidence to support the association between IMDADM2 and implantation and placentation via trophoblast invasion in human pregnancy. In vitro studies have demonstrated that IMDADM2 promotes trophoblast migration and invasion, which are essential processes for successful implantation and the formation of the placenta. Additionally, IMDADM2 has been found to regulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix during trophoblast invasion. Furthermore, studies have reported that IMDADM2 expression is upregulated in human endometrial tissues during the window of implantation and in placental tissues throughout pregnancy. This suggests a potential role for IMDADM2 in regulating endometrial receptivity and placental development. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which IMDADM2 contributes to implantation and placentation in human pregnancy and to determine its clinical relevance in reproductive disorders, such as recurrent miscarriage or preeclampsia.", "There is no direct evidence or research available that indicates mentors would decrease compliance with best sterile practices during central venous catheter placement in the trauma resuscitation unit. In general, mentors are experienced healthcare professionals who are trained to provide guidance and supervision to less experienced staff. Their role typically includes ensuring proper adherence to best practices, including sterile practices, to promote a safe environment for both the patient and healthcare provider. Some studies have shown that supervision, training, and feedback from experienced personnel can actually lead to improved compliance with best sterile practices. Therefore, we could assume that, in general, mentors would be more likely to positively influence compliance with practices such as central venous catheter placement in the trauma resuscitation unit. However, it is vital to consider that the effectiveness of a mentor's guidance or supervision may vary depending on the mentor's experience, communication skills, and the mentee's willingness to learn and comply with protocols. Consistent and comprehensive training, as well as promoting a culture of safety and adherence to guidelines, may further improve compliance with sterile practices.", "I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses. However, despite its exploration of some truly intriguing philosophical concepts, \"Cerebral Heights\" ultimately falls flat, leaving the audience wanting more. The film's premise is enticing: in a not-so-distant future, humans have developed the technology to transfer knowledge directly into their minds, eliminating the need for conventional learning. As this new era dawns, we follow protagonist Dr. Amelia Rayne, a brilliant neuroscientist responsible for creating this groundbreaking tech. Unfortunately, the strong beginning ends up being overshadowed by a weak plot and uninspired dialogue. The movie's saving grace lies in the captivating performance of the lead actress, who breathes life into Dr. Rayne, capturing both complex emotions and engrossing intellectual exchanges. The supporting cast, unfortunately, fails to deliver the same passion, leaving the audience detached from many characters and their struggles. Visually, \"Cerebral Heights\" excels in capturing the futuristic landscape, with imaginative and sleek cinematography. But the glossy exterior cannot wholly redeem the meandering storyline, which often becomes bogged down in esoteric discussions and forgets to effectively answer the questions it poses. Despite its shortcomings, \"Cerebral Heights\" is a valiant attempt to explore the implications of a world where humans no longer need to learn in conventional ways. It raises thought-provoking questions about education, human connection, and the implications of rapidly advancing technology. If you're seeking a think-piece that sparks philosophical conversations, give this movie a shot. Just be prepared for a lot of unrealized potential.", "Y-chromosome phylogeographic analysis of the Greek-Cypriot population does indeed reveal elements consistent with Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements. This type of analysis provides insights into the genetic history of a population, as it focuses on the Y-chromosome, which is passed down exclusively from father to son. Studies of the Greek-Cypriot population have identified specific haplogroups, or groups of similar Y-chromosomes, that point to a significant demographic contribution from Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements. These haplogroups include populations that migrated from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and the Levant during the Neolithic period - around 9,000 to 7,000 years ago - and the Bronze Age period that followed. One study, for instance, identified haplogroups J2 and E-M123 as being associated with the spread of Neolithic farmers from Anatolia, while haplogroup G2a was prevalent in the Bronze Age population. Moreover, a considerable proportion of Y-chromosome haplogroups found in the Greek-Cypriot population can be traced back to the Bronze Age. In summary, Y-chromosome phylogeographic analysis of the Greek-Cypriot population supports the notion that this population carries the genetic legacy of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements in the Eastern Mediterranean region.", "Public Displays of Affection Become Catalyst for Social Media Swarm Two women embracing on a train platform have unwittingly caused a sensation over a contentious issue. A photograph taken of their hug sparked a heated debate on the acceptance of public displays of affection among same-sex couples, which has now exploded on social media. Nelson Felippe, a resident of Rio de Janeiro, posted the image showing two women hugging among bustling commuters with an accompanying message that appeared to express his disapproval of the scene. The Facebook post quickly generated a considerable amount of interest, with over 100,000 shares in 24 hours. However, an unexpected twist soon emerged, as it was revealed that Nelson's post was not intended as an attack on public displays of affection or the LGBTQ community, but rather, was purposefully crafted in a satirical manner to highlight and criticize homophobic attitudes that continue to persist in today's society. The women in the photo, as it turns out, were simply friends embracing each other during a chance encounter, and were not involved in any romantic gesture. As the post gained momentum, its true intent began to resonate with many who saw it as a clever commentary on the widespread disapproval and discrimination that still exists in many areas of the world. The photograph's rapid circulation on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram served as a reminder that public opinion on such socially sensitive issues can often be swayed by the power of suggestion and manipulation. Despite the prevalence of progressive ideals and ideologies relating to equal rights for LGBTQ individuals, the polarized responses to the image of two women hugging reveal that societal opinions remain disparate. As the debate continues, advocates and allies stand together in their resolve to challenge and change the mindset of those who remain fiercely opposed to public displays of affection among same-sex couples. In the end, it is the power of images such as these, and the heightening of awareness around the issues they present, that will drive the continued dialogue and education necessary to overcome long-standing prejudices. Nelson Felippe's clever social commentary provides a timely reminder that, in the ongoing battle for equal rights and acceptance, every voice counts.", "Yes, \"They human beings, they are Swazi\": intersecting stigmas and the positive health, dignity, and prevention needs of HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Swaziland is a research study.

The custom-made piano features half a million Swarovski crystals and was created following a request from an unnamed buyer described as an 'influential Sheikh' in Doha, Qatar. Goldfinch, a Cambridge-based piano maker, took six months to build it, with every crystal applied by hand. Scroll down for video . A 420,000 piano has been hand decorated with half a million Swarovski crystals . Company director Tomas Norman, whose family has been handcrafting high-end pianos for more than 40 years, said: 'It's been a delight to bring another customer's dream to reality. 'We love nothing more than blurring the lines between timeless tradition and contemporary British art, but it's not all about good looks - our craftsmanship is combined with cutting-edge technology for that seamless finish and ultimate musicality.' He claimed the company is the only piano manufacturer in the world which offers an almost limitless selection of shapes, sizes, colours, materials and textures. The piano was made in collaboration with British contemporary artist Lauren Baker. The sparkling piano was created for an 'influential Sheikh' in Doha, Qatar . When the light hits the crystals they shine in different colours . Previous projects have included a piano colour-matched to an RAF fighter plane and a baby grand piano that appears to melt down three flights of stairs. The company typically produces pianos priced between 100,000 and 1 million and has shipped instruments to Hong Kong, Dubai and Los Angeles in the past. Artist Lauren Baker added the half a million crystals by hand saying she has an obsession with working with the shining gem stones . Lauren said her work: 'I'm really drawn to working with crystals. My imagination runs wild with ideas. 'I've got an obsession and a fascination with crystals so this is the perfect project. It's every little detail that counts. 'It's the meticulous minute detail of the pieces that form the beautiful final outcome. It's all about the way the crystals catch the light and refract into a prism of colours. That makes it so extravagant.' Even the name of the piano was done in crystals, placed on with tweezers . Goldfinch regularly make custom pianos which range between 100,000 and 1million .", "Eichard Gere Diane Lane back again in another romantic love story.

Recently the FDA approved Enfuvirtide, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat of HIV-1 gp41, as an anti-AIDS agent. Enfuvirtide and C34, another anti HIV-1 peptide, exert their inhibitory activity by binding to a leucineisoleucine zipper-like sequence in gp41, thus inhibiting a conformational change of gp41 required for its activation. We suggest that peptides corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat of the S2 protein may serve as inhibitors for SARS-CoV entry.", "This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. Packed with cliches, overused storylines, and ridiculously outdated fashion, \"Back to the 90s\" takes us on a nostalgic journey to a time of dial-up internet, brick cell phones, and boy bands galore. It's not the kind of film you watch for a profound experience or in-depth character analysis. No, \"Back to the 90s\" instead offers a fond trip down memory lane for those who grew up in that era, and a taste of the excessive cheesiness that defined the decade. The story follows a group of teenagers, clad in oversized neon windbreakers and high-waisted jeans, who find themselves accidentally catapulted back to 1995. Encountering a mishmash of popular culture references, from Tamagotchis to VHS tapes, they must navigate their way through the decade as they search for a way back home. The ensemble cast does a commendable job of capturing the spirit of the 90s and delivering cheesy one-liners with unbridled enthusiasm, making the movie equal parts cringe-worthy and endearing. Though the plot is essentially an endless barrage of callbacks to all things 90s, the film's self-aware nature allows audiences to appreciate the humor in it. The cinematography is surprisingly impressive, with powerful colors and interesting camera angles adding depth to otherwise kitschy sets and scenes. The soundtrack, boasting a medley of beloved tunes from the 90s, will have audiences tapping their feet and itching to boogie. In conclusion, \"Back to the 90s\" is a hilariously dated blast from the past that both pokes fun at and pays homage to the wild and wacky decade. From slap bracelets to platform shoes, the film is campy, nostalgic, and an entertaining trip down memory lane. Go ahead and indulge in the absurdity and laugh in the face of nostalgia while watching this delightful gem.", "Thousands of commuters were left stranded at Waterloo station this afternoon after an earlier incident in which a person was struck by a train scuppered the entire day's services. Frustrated passengers packed the concourse this afternoon as services in and out of the city centre were delayed or cancelled. The chaos ensued after Network Rail was forced to close a section of the tracks between Wimbledon and Surbiton when a person was struck by a train. Scroll down for video . Thousands of commuters were left stranded at Waterloo station during rush hour after a part closure of the track between Surbiton and Wimbledon . South West Trains was forced to cancel trains on all of its services following the incident this afternoon . As British Transport Police investigators surveyed the scene the closure meant several trains and countless staff were stuck at the wrong end of the line. 'Services in and out of Waterloo have been severely affected following an incident in the Surbiton area where a person was struck by a train,' said a Network Rail spokesman. 'While lines are now open this has resulted in a huge number of trains and staff being out of place with a number of services cancelled or changed.' The statement added staff were working 'flat out' to recover the service but delays were to be expected into the night. 'Passengers should check before they travel and consider any alternative routes,' they added. South West Trains warned there would be cancellations to all routes as a result of the incident.At 9pm delays of up to 30 minutes were still being experienced on South West trains. The situation was worsened when another train broke down, a spokesman said this evening. 'Where the incident occurred is a very, very busy section of the railway. It services 10 of what we call pathways so it had a knock-on effect.' Network Rail said staff were working 'flat out' to catch up after services resumed following the part closure . The section of the track where the incident took place is used by 10 different 'pathways' leading in and out of the station . There were still delays of up to 30 minutes at around 9pm on Monday night some five hours after the incident .", "There is experimental evidence that supports the concept that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at threonine 668 (T668) influences its processing and association with centrosomes. Studies have shown that phosphorylation of APP at T668 occurs during mitosis and is highly restricted to dividing cells. This phosphorylation event seems to play a role in the observed altered processing of APP and generation of amyloid-beta (A) peptides, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Phosphorylated APP at T668 (pT668-APP) has been found to accumulate in centrosomes during mitosis. Centrosomes play a key role in cell division, as they are involved in the formation of mitotic spindles that ensure proper chromosome segregation. The localization of pT668-APP at centrosomes suggests that it may participate in the regulation of cell division. Moreover, it has been reported that the altered processing of APP, associated with the generation of A peptides, is regulated by cell cycle-dependent kinases that control the phosphorylation of APP at T668. Inhibition of these kinases affects the generation of A, highlighting the importance of this phosphorylation event in APP processing. Overall, APP phosphorylation at T668 during mitosis may affect its processing and lead to its association with centrosomes. Further research is needed to fully understand the relevance of this phosphorylation event, its role in cell cycle regulation, and implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.", "Bean, Kevin Perry, UK TV creations that have made successful transitions onto the BIG screen.

However, some studies have found differences in adrenomedullin levels in patients with different types of glaucoma. For example, one study found that adrenomedullin levels in the aqueous humor were significantly higher in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) compared to patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and healthy controls. Another study found that adrenomedullin levels were significantly higher in the aqueous humor of patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG) compared to those with POAG and PACG, as well as healthy controls. These studies suggest that there may be differences in adrenomedullin levels in the aqueous humor of patients with different types of glaucoma. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to further investigate the role of adrenomedullin in glaucoma pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.", "Surgical excision of heterotopic ossification (HO) can potentially lead to the re-emergence of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) populations responsible for recurrence. However, the exact mechanism and risk factors for recurrence after surgery are not yet fully understood. Heterotopic ossification is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues, often following trauma, surgery, or other inflammatory conditions. Mesenchymal stem cells play a key role in the process, as they can differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation. During the surgical excision of HO, it is not uncommon for some of the surrounding tissues to be disrupted or damaged, which could lead to the stimulation and activation of local MSC populations. These activated MSCs may then differentiate into osteoblasts and contribute to the recurrence of HO. To minimize the risk of recurrence, a combination of treatments may be employed. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or radiation therapy can be used pre- or post-operatively to inhibit the differentiation of MSCs and reduce the risk of HO formation. However, even with these interventions, recurrence can still occur in some cases. In summary, surgical excision of heterotopic ossification may lead to the re-emergence of mesenchymal stem cell populations responsible for recurrence. However, the precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood, and further studies are needed to determine the risk factors for recurrence and the most effective preventive strategies.", "Well, for this abomination of a film, I wasn't expecting anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. Somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when I didn't have any. Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. Actually Evan Almighty was had the EXACT same plot outline as Noah, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far-superior movie that was actually FUNNY. Another thing, did anyone get sick of Wanda Sykes' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. Despite the fact that I basically had already seen the film ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty has to be the most predictable movie I've ever seen. I figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off Noah left and right. In conclusion, if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty, and are already sick of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in, liked Bruce Almighty, and don't want to see a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, then please, don't see this piece of garbage.", "Person1: Really?

The big Belgian has shone under Louis van Gaal in recent weeks but he endured an evening to forget as the 20-year-old man-marked him superbly during the Blues' 1-0 victory. Mourinho gave an insight into his instructions to Zouma after the game, explaining that he'd asked the young Frenchman to turn the match into a '10 against 10' clash. Chelsea's Kurt Zouma tussles with Marouane Fellaini during his side's 1-0 win against Manchester United . Zouma was deployed in a defensive midfield role so that he could deal with the threat of United star Fellaini . Speaking to chelseafc.comafter the final whistle, Mourinho said: 'I told Zouma I want the game to be 10 against 10, I didn't want the game to be 11 against 11. 'During the week we were working for that and the game was 10 against 10.' Zouma, who also played in midfield away at West Ham and in the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham, was pleased with the job he did against the 'on fire' ex-Everton man. He said: 'I had to stay with [Marouane] Fellaini because we knew he is on fire at the moment. 'He has scored a lot of goals so I had to keep an eye on him, and I think I did it well. I had to be physical with him and stay close to him. 'The game was very difficult. The most important thing was that we had one chance and we scored. We defended very well. Manchester United didn't have many chances to score. We stayed compact.' Zouma wrestles Fellaini to the ground as Chelsea continued their bid for a fourth Premier League title . Fellaini has been in excellent form but he was unable to impact the game with Zouma watching his every move . Mourinho was similarly impressed with the performance of the former Saint-Etienne starlet, adding: 'See the jobs he is doing for us, as a central defender playing against [Sergio] Aguero, as a central defender playing against [Raheem] Sterling. 'He played as the holding midfield player against Tottenham in a system with only one holding midfield player. 'Against Man United he played to stop Fellaini from playing in the box. He is doing amazing jobs for us. He is mentally very, very strong, too. Not just physically, mentally he is very strong. 'He's learned a lot from a tactical point of view since his arrival. So we can imagine with him being aged 20, Chelsea has 10 years of Zouma.' Jose Mourinho believes that Zouma could play for Chelsea for at least the next 10 years .", "Manchester United legend Eric Cantona has named Paris Saint-Germain's Javier Pastore as the world's best player and hailed him as \"the most creative\" player in the world. \"I love Pastore, he's got something special,\" said Cantona. \"He can win in Manchester United. They've got the money! No, really, I think Pastore is the most talented player in football today - the most creative. He's from Argentina and he's playing in Paris - France will win the World Cup in 2014 because he's playing in France.\" Despite his admiration for the Argentine, however, Pastore has not been a regular starter in the eyes of many this season. Since his 29m (37m) transfer from Palermo to PSG in 2011, he has scored three goals and made five assists in the current campaign. Nevertheless, his performances have been impressive and he is widely regarded as one of the best players in Ligue 1. Cantona also claimed that Spain only had their domestic dominance and the core of Barcelona at the 2010 World Cup to thank for their success on the world stage. \"Look at Spain today, we say they're the best team in the world - that's a joke! If you take Spain, you take Barcelona - Barcelona made Spain win the World Cup. How many players from Barcelona play in the Spanish team? Seven in eight? They carry the team, because the other ones can't stand them because they know they cannot win!\" pointed out Cantona.

So among the simplistic plot, Van Peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats an improved version of himself in this disappointing film. \"Metal Justice\" is a film that tries to capitalize on the success of the iconic '90s action man, Jean-Claude Van Damme, but lacks the charisma and riveting fight sequences that made Van Damme's movies so memorable. Instead, what we're left with is a predictable and unexciting series of battles and chases between Van Peebles and the government agents hell-bent on capturing him. The action sequences are mediocre at best, with many of the fights feeling slow and poorly choreographed. Even the CGI and special effects leave much to be desired, as they seem hastily thrown together and not up to par with the standard of today's action films. The climactic battle between Van Peebles and his upgraded counterpart feels overdone and lacks any real sense of suspense or intensity. Additionally, the plot itself lacks any depth or development, with the characters feeling one-dimensional and flat. Van Peebles does his best with what he's given, but there just isn't enough substance in the script for him to truly shine. The film's attempt at including a moral message about humanity versus machinery gets lost amid the lackluster action and weak storytelling. Overall, \"Metal Justice\" is a forgettable action flick that had the potential to be a cult classic but falls short due to its uninspired plot, underwhelming action sequences, and lack of depth in both characterization and message. Fans of Van Peebles may find some enjoyment in seeing him play a robotic soldier, but for those looking for an exciting and engaging action experience, it's best to look elsewhere.", "A mother-of-two claims her face was left covered in angry red welts after drinking a bottle of Tesco wine which reeked of bleach.

The storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. The production values stink of cheese. In fact, a total LACK of production values would have been better...at least the film might have seemed grittier that way. The ADR is laughably bad and omni-present in the film. It's debatable as to whether or not ANY of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used.The performances are, for the most part, horrible, though there are a few exceptions. In those exceptions, however, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times. (i.e. characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye. Bad Direction.) Also, the constant \"weapon sound effects\" (magazines being loaded, slides being cocked, etc.) are completely overused and, more often than not, totally out of sync with the on-screen actions. Add to this cheesy \"Bad Guy\" vocal distortion for the lead villain (mainly so that you KNOW he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film), and you have a recipe for disaster.The situations in the film go well beyond standard \"suspension of disbelief\" and become downright laughable. One lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he DECIDES to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself. So, my questions are...why didn't he do this sooner, and why does he even HAVE the butterfly knife. He wasn't searched? RIGHT. This is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this 90-minute package.In whole, \"The Hangmen\" plays like an unbearably bad R-rated TV movie from the '80s.

In all too many ways, the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So, while director Melville and the actors did great jobs, it all seems like a case of Deja vu. Because of this, I had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score.The one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with Corey, a career criminal just released from prison! Both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch. Apart from that, as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime. I also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached mannersomething relatively common in French crime films but rare among American films until recent years.Overall, extremely well-crafted and worth seeing...if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, direction and a lot of great tension.", "Multiple issues must be considered when selecting a factor VIII concentrate for patients with hemophilia A including efficacy, availability, risk of transmission of infectious agents, risk of inhibitor development and cost.

Controversy exists, however, with regard to a higher risk of inhibitor development with recombinant products. The higher cost of Advate can also potentially play a role in product choice. Overall every patient and their family must be presented with the advantages and disadvantages of all factor VIII concentrates, and be allowed to make an informed decision about which product to use for treatment.", "This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's (the Sandy Dennis character) apartment. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.The characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the trademark Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis. It's definitely one of her darker characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the \"mute\" young man. Regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small part. The solemn, moody set fits the content of the story very well. In short, this movie is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression, and desperation. Be patient, soak up the atmosphere, and pay attention to the wonderfully written script.I praise Robert Altman. This is one of his many films that deals with unconventional, fascinating subject matter. This film is disturbing, but it's sincere and it's sure to elicit a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual film - some might even say bizarre - this is worth the time.Unfortunately, it's very difficult to find in video stores. You may have to buy it off the internet.", "DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) and POMS (Profile of Mood States) measures can potentially provide some information related to cocaine dependence treatment outcomes, but they are not direct markers of cocaine dependence or treatment success. DHEAS is a hormone produced in the adrenal glands, which has been studied in relation to stress, mood, and cognitive function. Some studies have suggested that lower DHEAS levels may be associated with higher relapse rates in people with substance use disorders, but the relationship is not fully understood. As a result, measuring DHEAS levels might provide some information about an individual's potential response to treatment, but it does not directly identify treatment outcomes or dependence itself. POMS is a psychological rating scale used to assess various mood states, such as tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. It has been used to explore individuals' subjective experiences during substance use and recovery, as well as their emotional and psychological well-being. Although POMS measures might help identify individuals with certain mood disturbances or psychological challenges that can influence substance use and treatment outcomes, it is not a direct predictor of treatment success for cocaine dependence. In summary, DHEAS and POMS measures might provide some additional information about factors that can influence treatment outcomes for individuals with cocaine dependence, but they do not specifically predict or identify those outcomes. A combination of clinical, biological, and psychological assessments would be more suitable for evaluating treatment success in individuals with cocaine dependence.", "People, get a clue! \"Mystery at Baker Mansion\" is the whodunit we've all been waiting for!

The mountain village will offer a unique perspective on rural life and the impact of economic progress in such areas. I will go ahead and make the necessary arrangements for our visit tomorrow. Can I assume you'll be joining us for the entire day or will you need to return at a specific time?", "Ander Herrera has shunned comparisons with Paul Scholes, saying 'there will never be another'. The stylish Spaniard has been hailed as the one player who could take over Scholes' mantle of creating and scoring goals from midfield but modest Herrera has been quick to distance himself from the former England international. Herrera, 25, took part in one of Manchester United Foundation's Dream Days on Monday, meeting up with ill children and adults at Carrington. Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has played down comparisons with Paul Scholes . Scholes, pictured celebrating in January 2012, was known for ability to score goals from midfield . Afterwards he took to his Facebook page to answer questions from supporters who compared him to Old Trafford favourite Scholes, who scored 107 goals in 499 games for United. Herrera, though, said: 'There will never be another Scholes. He was a one off.' Herrera has scored seven goals in 26 appearances since his 28.8million arrival from Athletic Bilbao last summer and says his favourite strike so far was his spectacular opener in the 2-0 FA Cup win over Yeovil Town but hopes 'the best one is still to come'. Herrera's favourite goal for United came against League One side Yeovil in the FA Cup third round . Scholes smashes home one of his 107 goals for Manchester United against Reading at Old Trafford . In a United Facebook question and answer session, he went to explain that he wears both 'Ander' and 'Herrera' on his shirt as he is superstitious. 'I did it before in Bilbao, and I am superstitious. I started using 'Ander Herrera' at Athletic a few years ago and I had a very good time there so I wanted to keep putting it on my shirt. I think Marcos Rojo is the same. Actually, in Spain, everyone has at least three names including the last name of both their dad and their mum. 'I always play passionately - for the team and our supporters. I am emotional. Every win and every victory makes me happy but maybe I hope the most emotional moments are coming. I am sure of that, in fact, because I am at United.'", "A good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction, \"The End of the Barrel\" is an eye-opening and thought-provoking film that everyone should watch, especially students. Director John Smith brings to light the harsh realities of our reliance on fossil fuels and the consequences that we face should we continue down this path. The documentary first delves into the history of oil and how it has shaped the world we live in today. It illustrates how our increased dependence on this finite resource has led to global conflicts, geopolitical tensions, and economic instability. Smith interviews experts in the field and includes archival footage, providing an engaging historical context to our oil addiction. The film then addresses the current issues surrounding our energy consumption, focusing on the severe impacts it has on our environment and global climate. Through captivating visuals, it highlights the widespread damage caused by pollution, deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels. This section of the documentary effectively underscores the urgency to transition from traditional energy sources to cleaner, greener alternatives such as solar and wind power. Lastly, \"The End of the Barrel\" touches upon the concept of peak oil production - the point at which the extraction of oil will reach its maximum level before beginning an irreversible decline. The film warns that the world is dangerously unprepared for the coming energy deficit and that drastic changes in energy consumption need to occur soon to avoid catastrophic consequences. What sets this documentary apart from others is its ability to convey complex concepts in a way that is both accessible and engaging for the general public. The film is not only informative but also offers hope by presenting potential solutions and alternatives for our energy future. \"The End of the Barrel\" is a powerful, compelling, and necessary documentary that shines a light on one of the most pressing issues of our time, and emphasizes the importance of educating the public about our energy consumption and its consequences. This movie should be mandatory viewing for all students as part of their education, inspiring them to become part of the solution and contribute positively to our future. Overall, \"The End of the Barrel\" is an essential, timely, and provocative film that deserves a wide audience and should not be missed.", "Total Garbage!!! That's the only way to describe the latest entry in the action-thriller genre, \"Detective Disaster.\" The movie, starring A-list actors in the most underwhelming performances of their careers, completely falls apart as it tries to string together a coherent story. The movie begins with what could have been an exciting car chase sequence through the bustling streets of New York City. However, it is quickly tarnished by terrible CGI and the fact that the bad guy and our hero, Detective Johnny Allstar, played by the wooden John Doe, repeatedly pass the same street corner. It's almost like the film's producers chose to shoot the movie in just one square block, showing how little they cared about quality. The actual plot of the movie involves a dangerous drug lord, a kidnapped scientist, and an impending nuclear disaster. Somehow even with these captivating storylines, Detective Disaster manages to make it all as boring as watching paint dry - a particularly appalling feat given the actors' talent. Every attempt at suspense is met with poor editing, and the supposed witty dialogue comes off as cringe-worthy and forced. Even the action sequences fall flat due to unimaginative stunts and overuse of slow-motion effects. In conclusion, \"Detective Disaster\" is a prime example of a movie that hides its lack of creativity behind big names and high budgets. Its only redeeming quality is that it serves as a cautionary tale for how not to make an action film. Do yourself a favor and skip this trainwreck.", "Person1: I understand, that can be quite frustrating.

This cinematic disaster attempts to merge the worlds of comedy and corporate satire, but ultimately results in a grotesque mutation that fails on all counts. The film's plot is as weak as the lead character's hair color, and the humor is so crude, you'd wish someone had stepped in to perform an emergency script exorcism. Carrot Top, known for his frenetic stand-up comedy and use of zany props, proves that his particular brand of humor simply does not translate to the big screen. His character, a wacky inventor who inherits a large corporation, lacks any semblance of depth or relatability, making you question the sanity of anyone who thought bringing this monstrosity to life was a good idea. The supporting cast, including the usually talented Courtney Thorne-Smith and Jack Warden, are sadly reduced to mere pawns in this chessboard of mediocrity, unable to save the film from its own diabolical nonsense. You can't help but feel a sense of despair as you watch them attempt to navigate the chaotic and nonsensical script. In a parallel universe, this film might have been an interesting commentary on the absurd nature of corporate America. However, in our reality, it serves as nothing more than a painful reminder that some things should never see the light of the projector. In conclusion, \"Chairman of the Board\" and Carrot Top's ATT commercials are a horrifying testament to the failures of cinematic comedy in the late '90s - a time when the color orange should have been banned from all screens, large and small. If you value your sanity and your retinas, avoid this film and anything associated with it at all costs.", "To sum it all up, skip End of Days and watch rent Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate instead. While both films share themes of religion, the supernatural, and an impending apocalypse, The Ninth Gate excels with its mysterious and masterfully crafted plotline. Roman Polanski's film, starring Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, takes viewers on an intricate journey through a rare book dealer who stumbles upon a series of enigmatic, ancient texts. The Ninth Gate's stunning visuals, coupled with its beautifully haunting soundtrack, encompass the film with an atmospheric depth that End of Days lacks. End of Days may entertain those who enjoy the suspense and action of a Schwarzenegger-led thriller, but it falls short in comparison to the complex story and character development in The Ninth Gate. Director Polanski offers more substance, creating a nuanced film that is both a gripping thriller and a psychological tour-de-force. In conclusion, those in search of a movie that resonates beyond its two-hour runtime and skillfully intertwines religious themes and symbolism should definitely rent Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate. It's an entirely different experience from the cliche, action-heavy End of Days, and one that viewers surely won't forget.", "This is the deafening moment a mother of six boysfinds out she's finally having a girl after the seventh time trying.

When I first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987, I thought it was all out hilarious! Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed accent and wackyfunky look. The all-time funniest part is when Madonna (Nikki) screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunne (Louden) trips and falls at the apartment interview scene. ALANiS Rocks. Madonna's character Nikki stealsshop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time. \"Didn't rob nothin', when you rob a store you stick up the cashier. We busted a few tapes, there's a bit of a difference\" I love that!!! It's classic. ALANiS Rocks. I don't know why this movie got slammed the way it did. I see nothing wrong with it - course maybe if you're a huge Madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome. Anyone out there who wants to see some funny, classic entertainment then watch \"Who's That Girl?\" And another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist, ALANiS will always \"rock ya\" completely to the end!

Her acting is superb!", "Yes, recombination pattern reanalysis of some HIV-1 circulating recombination forms (CRFs) suggests the necessity and difficulty of revision. HIV-1 is known for its high genetic diversity and capacity to recombine, generating novel recombinant forms. This genetic diversity complicates the control and prevention of HIV-1 infection and challenges the development of effective vaccines and treatments. Reanalysis of recombination patterns in HIV-1 CRFs is essential as it helps researchers better understand the complex evolutionary history of the virus. Furthermore, it can lead to the identification of novel CRFs and provide insights into the transmission dynamics and the epidemiological impact of different CRFs. However, the recombination analysis process is complicated and presents various challenges, which include: 1. The high genetic variability of HIV-1 makes it difficult to accurately identify recombination breakpoints and parental strains responsible for the creation of new recombinant forms. 2. The limited availability of full-length genome sequences for some CRFs can hinder the comprehension of their recombination patterns or identification of new recombinant forms. 3. Continuous genetic recombination events can result in complex patterns of genetic variation, making it challenging to trace the relationships between CRFs and their parental strains. 4. The rapid evolution and rapid transmission of HIV-1 can lead to a diverse array of recombinant forms, some of which may not yet be identified, further complicating efforts to understand and control the virus. Despite these challenges, recombination pattern reanalysis of HIV-1 CRFs is crucial for informing public health efforts and guiding the development of more effective vaccines and therapies against HIV-1 infection. Ongoing research and development of computational tools and technologies are expected to improve the accuracy and efficiency of recombination analysis, contributing to a better understanding of the virus and its ongoing evolution.", "First of all, this movie is gross to the point of nauseating, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried watching it because it looked like it might be funny, but it soon became quite disturbing with the ice cream made out of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg witnessing the gruesome murder of an ice cream man (Greg subsequently goes crazy and grows up to be the title character) by what appear to be mob assassins. There is no explanation for this murder, making it the biggest WTF moment in the entire movie. Other, lesser WTF moments include the surreal asylum Greg goes to (featuring evil clowns), a woman speaking in tongues because she has been possessed by the Holy Spirit (what this has to do with anything I don't know), and the fact that Olivia \"Holy crap has her career tanked this badly\" Hussey is in it.None of these are good enough reasons to watch it. The only reason is for the character Tuna, who is a skinny kid with pillows stuffed under his shirt so that he looks like a fat kid. For some reason this struck me as hilarious. I stayed up far longer into the night than I should have watching this movie just to figure out if there was some reason they couldn't use an actual fat kid for the role. Although I fell asleep before the end, I've gathered from other reviews that Tuna ends up losing the \"weight.\" Okay, so they didn't have the budget to pull this off realistically. Suggestion to the director: how about making the character... not overweight? That's it; if the prospect of Tuna has not interested you enough, there is no other reason to acknowledge this film's existence. If disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your preferred source of entertainment, check out the far superior \"The Stuff\" instead.", "Football in Turkey has been suspended for one week following the armed attack on Fenerbahce's team bus on Saturday. Meanwhile, a Turkish official says police have detained two people suspected of involvement in the attack. Trabzon Governor Abdil Celil Oz said the two suspects were detained early on Tuesday and that one of them is believed to have followed the convoy while the other fired shots with a rifle at the bus. The decision to suspend football in Turkey affects both next weekend's Super Lig fixtures and the midweek cup quarter-finals, although Besiktas' match against Istanbul Basaksehir, the last of this weekend's Super Lig matches, is scheduled to go ahead on Monday evening. Fenerbahce's bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor, which Fener won 5-1, in Turkey's Super Lig. Five round marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attack . The window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday night . The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help after the attack . Fenerbahce on Sunday demanded that football be suspended until the incident was dealt with and the perpetrators punished, and on Monday a one-week suspension was announced by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) following a meeting with sports minister Akif Cagatay Kilic. 'This was a cowardly and treacherous attack,' Kilic said in comments on the TFF website. He added: 'I think it's important to make this response. This was an attack not just on Fenerbahce, but an attack on Turkish sport and Turkish football. I believe we will stand as one against it.' Kilic also wished a speedy recovery to the bus driver, named as Ufuk Kiran, who was injured in the attack. The club had posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen. The pictures also showed blood on the driver's seat and the steering wheel. The attack followed Fener's 5-1 win away to Rizespor. The bus was going over a viaduct on its way from the city of Rize to the airport in Trabzon to return to Istanbul when the incident occurred. Fenerbahce had temporarily gone top of the league with Saturday's win, although Galatasaray returned to the summit on Sunday by beating Karabukspor 4-2, and they sit two points clear with eight matches remaining.

Reversed OA flow direction is highly specific (100) for severe ipsilateral ICA stenosis or occlusion, with excellent positive predictive value, moderate negative predictive value, and limited sensitivity. OA flow reversal is not only quite specific for severe ICA disease, which may be helpful if the carotid CDUS is difficult or inadequate, but may also provide additional hemodynamic insights (i.e., the inadequacy of other collateral channels such as the anterior communicating artery).

But when I stumbled upon \"Attack of the Galactic Slime,\" my expectations were met with an unparalleled mix of absurdity and nostalgia. A low-budget, high-camp gem from the 1960s, this film is the epitome of laughably bad yet oh-so-entertaining sci-fi flicks. Let's start with the plot, or the lack thereof. A seemingly non-threatening form of alien goo lands on Earth, where it promptly begins to consume and duplicate every substance in its path, leading to the titular attack. In true skifee fashion, the dialogue is cheesy, the props are hokey, and the science is dubious at best, but the sense of wonder and awe prevalent in the period's cinema surprisingly shines through. The acting is far from polished, but this only heightens the enjoyment factor. The lead actor's attempt at portraying a heroic, stoic scientist is unintentionally hilarious, yet still elicits a cheer or two when he inevitably saves the day. The other performances similarly evoke nostalgic glee, as characters swerve between stiff '60s mannerisms and over-the-top, gasping-for-breath dramatics. But this movie's crowning achievement? Its creature effects. The \"galactic slime\" in question is simply green gelatin, brought to life by unseen hands. Watching this low-budget monster engulf toy cars and Barbie dolls aplomb is a hoot, while its eventual defeat by the humble power of soap is a climactic ending for the ages. In conclusion, \"Attack of the Galactic Slime\" is not a good movie by any conventional standard, but as a bad, old skifee movie, it's a hidden treasure. What it lacks in plot, characterization, and special effects, it more than makes up for in its unapologetic commitment to its absurd premise and campiness. To lovers of the genre, it's worth seeking out and relishing with friends, popcorn, and a willing suspension of disbelief.", "Analyses of Cypriot haplogroup data are consistent with two stages of prehistoric settlement.

'The recovery time for the footballer will depend on the progress he makes.' An Ikechukwu Uche penalty, after he himself was fouled by Medhi Lacen with 52 minutes played, was Villarreal's first goal in five league games but it was not enough to give them their first La Liga away win of the year. In a scrappy game Getafe deservedly drew level with a fine header from Castro after 64 minutes and Pedro Leon had the chance to win the game but his shot following a breakaway was parried by Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo. Villarreal have failed to win in seven games in all competitions and are sixth on 51 points. Getafe are 13th on 36 points.

The film explores the complicated emotions and experiences of its characters with both subtlety and depth, inviting the audience to reflect on their own lives and personal relationships. The stunning cinematography and carefully composed shots give the film a visual richness that complements its nuanced storytelling. The director's choice to unfold the narrative at a leisurely pace allows the audience to fully immerse themselves in the characters' world, and truly appreciate the exquisite attention to detail in every aspect of the film's production. The acting in this film is nothing short of spectacular - the entire cast gives powerful and authentic performances that resonate long after the credits have rolled. Their impactful portrayals of vulnerability and humanity make it impossible not to sympathize with their complex struggles. The film's atmospheric score further enhances the emotional intensity of its most poignant moments. However, potential viewers should be aware that this film is not for the faint of heart or easily bored. While its slow pacing and introspective focus may be challenging for some, others will find it refreshing and engrossing.

Those patients with an appropriate serum tumor marker decline had a longer event-free and overall survival. When evaluated separately, the rate of hCG decline was more predictive of treatment outcome than decline of AFP. The rate of serum tumor marker regression during the first two cycles of therapy is a clinically useful tool in assessing treatment outcome at an early point in therapy and may thereby identify patients who could benefit from a change to more intensive therapy.", "How do you know if a movie is good or not?

Person2: Not really. I'm not afraid of hard work and I know how to organize my day. I think I'll do a good job. Person1: But doing for practice isn't just for the company to profit, is it? It's also for you to get experience. Do you even know what you'll be doing? Person2: I'm not worried about that. I've got a lot of natural curiosity. And I'm very social, I'm sure I'll learn from all the other people there. Person1: What if they stick you in some backroom by yourself just copying papers or taking out the trash? Person2: I don't think that will happen. They asked for someone who was good at editing, organizing computer files and keeping track of deadlines.

The lower number of HER2-mutational analyses resulted from exhaustion of tumor tissue and DNA following mutational analysis of KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and PIK3CA. HER2 amplification was detected in 4 cases (2.3), while no mutation was found. HER2 expression correlated with expression of pAKT and cMET. Expression of HER2 and pAKT was associated with favorable overall survival in stage IV disease. HER2-expressing ADC more frequently harbored KRAS mutations, while HER2 expression was absent in all 4 cases with BRAF mutation. HER2-IHC was not predictive of HER2 gene amplification or mutation, which both were rare events in prospectively studied patients with advanced or metastatic ADC. Expression of HER2 and pAKT define a population of patients with stage IV ADC with a distinct disease course, who could benefit from specifically tailored pharmacotherapies.", "The 30-day mortality was 47 in the RAAA group and 12 in the EAAA group. The rupture type was the main predictor of the outcome for the RAAA patients, the mortalities being 88 and 29 among patients with free (n 16) and contained (n 35) ruptures, respectively. In conclusion, the best way of avoiding poor results in cases of emergency aneurysm repair is to aim at elective operations. After the rupture, the clinical course is mainly determined by the rupture type, which is unfortunately beyond the surgeon's control. Surgical expertise and the avoidance of technical error can significantly affect the survival.", "Predictors of unfavorable repeat biopsy results in men participating in a prospective active surveillance program can include several factors. Some common predictors are: 1. Age: Older men are at a higher risk of unfavorable repeat biopsy results compared to younger men. 2. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level: Higher PSA levels are commonly associated with a higher probability of unfavorable biopsy results. 3. PSA density: Higher PSA density, which is the PSA level divided by prostate volume, is also a significant predictor of unfavorable repeat biopsy findings. 4. Prostate size: Larger prostate sizes can indicate an increased risk of unfavorable biopsy results. 5. Number of positive cores and core involvement: The higher the number of positive cores and greater percentage core involvement on the initial biopsy, the greater the likelihood of unfavorable findings on re-biopsy. 6. Gleason Score: Higher Gleason scores on the initial biopsy may predict unfavorable biopsy outcomes upon repeat assessment. 7. Clinical stage: Higher clinical stages indicate greater tumor involvement and may predict a higher likelihood of unfavorable repeat biopsy results. 8. Time between biopsies: Shorter intervals between biopsies might be associated with a higher likelihood of unfavorable results, especially if there was evidence of cancer progression. 9. Family history: A family history of prostate cancer may suggest an increased risk of unfavorable repeat biopsy results. It's important to note that each patient is different, and factors may have varying degrees of influence on individual outcomes. It is essential to discuss these factors with a healthcare professional to make informed decisions regarding active surveillance and prostate cancer management.", "Chronic ethanol exposure increases the susceptibility of rat liver to increased injury by 1 or 3 repeat binge. Among other alterations, the activated levels of ERK1, and more so ERK2, were remarkably amplified by binge suggesting a role of these isotypes in the binge amplification of the injury. In contrast, p38 MAPK and JNK12 activities were not amplified. These binge-induced changes were also reflected in the increases in the RNA levels for egr-1 and PAI-1. This study offers chronic followed by repeat binge as a model for the study of progression of liver injury by ethanol and highlights the involvement of ERK1 and ERK2 isotypes in the amplification of liver injury by binge ethanol.", "Cytoplasm could potentially affect grain weight and filled-grain ratio in indica rice, as it is a major component of plant cells and plays a role in various cellular processes. Cytoplasm contains organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, which are involved in the production and storage of energy, protein synthesis, and other essential cellular functions. These processes can, in turn, impact the growth and development of the grain in rice. Moreover, cytoplasmic genetic factors, such as cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), have been reported to have a potential influence on grain yield and related traits in rice. These factors may lead to variations in grain weight and filled-grain ratio among different rice varieties. However, more research is needed to fully understand the extent and mechanisms of how cytoplasm affects grain weight and filled-grain ratio in indica rice. Genetic and environmental factors, along with their interactions, also play crucial roles in determining grain weight and filled-grain ratio. It is essential to consider these factors when assessing the overall impact of cytoplasm on these traits in indica rice.", "Person1: Oh, that's strange. I made the reservation a week ago.

A study by Thanos et al. (2001) suggested that enhancing dopaminergic function through selective overexpression of the D2 receptor gene within the nucleus accumbens resulted in decreased alcohol intake in alcohol-preferring rats. It has also been shown that similar manipulations can reduce the motivation to consume alcohol in non-preferring rats. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the dopaminergic system, especially D2 receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens, plays a critical role in modulating alcohol drinking behavior in rodents. Further research is needed to validate these findings in different animal models and eventually in humans.", "Yes, foveal light exposure is increased at the time of removal of silicone oil, and there is potential for phototoxicity. Silicone oil is used as a tamponade in various vitreoretinal surgeries, and its removal is often necessary for different reasons, one of which is the restoration of better visual function. The silicone oil changes the optical properties of the eye compared to the natural vitreous humor, and its removal may affect the amount of light reaching the fovea. Both intraoperative and postoperative light exposure after silicone oil removal can potentially increase phototoxicity risk. Intraoperative light exposure, due to high-intensity light sources (like endoilluminators) used during the surgery, can induce phototoxic injury. Postoperative light exposure, where the eye is not under the protection of the silicone oil anymore, may lead to increased light exposure to non-light-adapted retina, increasing the risk of phototoxicity. Surgeons should be mindful of the duration and intensity of light exposure during and after silicone oil removal, and patients should receive appropriate guidance to protect their eyes after surgery to minimize the risk of phototoxicity.", "(CNN) The underwater search area for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 looks set to double in size. Teams are scouring the depths of a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean for the remains of the passenger jet that disappeared more than a year ago with 239 people on board. So far, they've covered about 60 of the priority search zone without reporting any trace of the airliner. Families of passengers and crew members still have no answers about what happened to their loved ones. If the searchers haven't found anything by the time they've covered the entire 60,000-square-kilometer priority zone, the search will stretch into a new equally vast area, government officials from Malaysia, Australia and China announced Thursday. \"Ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370,\" the three countries said in a joint statement. The search of the current priority zone is expected to be completed in May. Covering the new zone could take as long as a year. At that point, \"all high probability search areas would have been covered,\" the governments said Thursday. The size of the doubled search area, the equivalent of more than 46,000 square miles, would be bigger than the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Flight 370 vanished after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing. Officials are still trying to figure out why it veered dramatically off course over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam and where exactly it ended up. An international team of experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far off the coast of Western Australia. The people on board the Boeing 777 came from various nations, but the majority were Chinese. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.", "Person1: Here they are.

Our findings imply modulation of oxygen binding via charge-charge interaction at the protein surface, which stabilize quaternary interactions among functional units to reduce detrimental effects of high pH on venous oxygen release. Of the observed partial haemocyanin sequence, residue 2545 formed a close link between the FU g surface and the active centre, suggesting a role as allosteric binding site. The prevalence of methionine at this site in polar octopods, implies regulation of oxygen affinity via increased sensitivity to allosteric metal binding. High sequence conservation of sites directly involved in oxygen binding indicates that functional modifications of octopod haemocyanin rather occur via more subtle mechanisms, as observed in this study.", "This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I've ever seen.

The Serie A champions are looking to bring in the Uruguayan striker to partner with Carlos Tevez, as they seek to bolster their attack for the upcoming season. However, Juventus will have to battle it out with Manchester United, who have also shown interest in the 34-year-old goal-scorer. Cavani's agent has recently sparked rumors of a possible move to England or Spain by stating that his client would be open to a transfer this summer. While Cavani has enjoyed a prolific career in Ligue 1 since joining PSG in 2013, repeatedly finding the back of the net and helping the Parisians maintain a firm grip on the domestic title, it is rumored that he has grown somewhat disillusioned with life in France. A move to a different league could provide a fresh challenge and reinvigorate the Uruguayan's passion for the game. Juventus, having recently lost legends Sergio Aguero and Mario Mandzukic, are eager to acquire a top-quality forward who can help them maintain their dominant status in Italian football, while also making a more significant impact on the European stage. In Cavani, they see a proven goal-scorer who can form a formidable partnership with the likes of Tevez and Paulo Dybala. Manchester United, on the other hand, have been looking to strengthen their attacking line after a disappointing Premier League campaign last season. While they have been linked with several high-profile names, Cavani's potential availability has drawn the interest of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who is keen to bolster his options up front. As the transfer window remains open, it will be interesting to see if either Juventus or Manchester United can convince PSG to part with their prolific striker, and where Cavani may decide to ply his trade next season.", "When I first saw the ad for this, I was like 'Oh here we go.

Cochlear implant (CI) users often face challenges in pitch perception due to degraded spectral information and poor place coding. To overcome these difficulties, specialized auditory training programs have been developed to enhance pitch perception and optimize the use of available cues. These training programs focus on improving the CI users' ability to discriminate pitch and recognize complex sound patterns like speech and music. These training programs can be either computer-based or therapist-led and usually involve tasks that require the listener to identify, compare, or categorize pitches or pitch contours. The tasks may start simple and gradually increase in complexity, incorporating complex note sequences and varying sound sources. Research has shown that such training can lead to improved pitch perception for CI users. These improvements can, in turn, lead to better speech recognition in noise, music perception, and overall communication ability. However, it is important to note that individual outcomes may vary depending on factors such as duration of deafness, age at implantation, and cognitive abilities. In conclusion, training of cochlear implant users can help improve pitch perception in the presence of competing place cues, but the outcomes may vary depending on individual factors. Continuous research and development of training strategies are essential to enhance the benefits of cochlear implantation and improve the quality of life for these individuals.", "I never fell asleep during a movie, until I watched the snoozefest that was \"The Slumbering.\" It started off with a promising premise - a mysterious sleep epidemic causing the world's population to fall into a deep slumber, with a group of insomniacs scrambling to find a solution. However, the film quickly descended into a series of drawn-out and tiresome discussions amongst the group about the nature of sleep and its impact on humanity. I found myself struggling to keep my eyes open as it felt like the filmmakers were trying their hardest to make the audience fall asleep in an unfortunate example of life imitating art. The film's pacing was unbearably slow, and its lackluster performances did nothing to hold my interest. The main characters were one-dimensional, and even though they were supposed to be insomniacs, they seemed to have no sense of urgency in their pursuit to save the world. The subplot involving a forbidden love between two of the insomniacs never really took off and felt more like an afterthought used to pad out the film's runtime. Visually, \"The Slumbering\" delivered sparse and bland cinematography. The lack of vibrant and creative visuals only added to the monotony of the film, and the eerie score seemed to be trapped in a never-ending loop that lulled the audience into a dreary state of mind. In conclusion, \"The Slumbering\" is a film that can be summed up in one word: sleepy. It tries to tackle big ideas about sleep and human existence but ends up being a boring and forgettable experience. I'd recommend something much more exciting and well-executed to spend your time on - or if you're really struggling with insomnia, maybe \"The Slumbering\" could at least serve a practical purpose.", "This would probably be a good film to see....provided you've already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you.

These local changes could not be detected by arterial or mixed venous lactate concentrations, pH, and PCO2 determinations. Under closed-system conditions, mesenteric CO2 accumulation causes an impairment of the CO2-HCO3- buffer, resulting in an unchanged cHCO3-. With impaired mesenteric perfusion, only intramucosal PCO2 alterations occur and an intramucosal pH calculation based on systemic cHCO3-changes is not necessarily correct. Therefore, the only parameter of importance is the intraluminal measurement of intramucosal PCO2 that can reflect isolated mesenteric changes. Thus, we recommended abolishing the terms \"intramucosal pH measurement\" and \"gastric tonometry\" and propose using the definition \"intramucosal PCO2 measurement.\"", "BBC iPlayer plagued by missing endings in popular radio dramas Listeners of BBC's iPlayer have complained about the unexpected cut-off in the vital last minutes of several radio dramas, including popular shows like Dad's Army and Hancock's Half Hour.

Paris, France - French photographer Fabien Le Coq has captured something extraordinary in the seemingly ordinary subject of trees. In a collection of breathtaking photos, Le Coq takes viewers on a journey skyward, photographing trees from the bottom looking up, unveiling the hidden beauty and awe-inspiring patterns revealed by their branches. As the world around us continues to evolve rapidly with technology and urbanization, it is easy to lose sight of the natural wonders that surround our everyday lives. Le Coq's unique approach to photographing nature reminds us to appreciate the timeless beauty of trees and consider the unexplored perspectives that may reveal something new. \"Each tree has its own personality,\" Le Coq explains, referring to the unique patterns and structures of the branches weaving across the sky. The images he captures are reminiscent of intricate mosaics or abstract paintings, demonstrating the splendor of the natural world when viewed from an unconventional angle. Le Coq began his journey in photography at a young age, inspired by the landscapes and natural beauty that surrounded him. As he refined his skills, he discovered a passion for capturing the magnificence of trees, which he believes are an essential part of our connection to the Earth. \"The tree is the most anchored element in the ground, and at the same time, the one that rises most towards the sky,\" says Le Coq, emphasizing the symbolic importance of trees as connectors between the terrestrial and celestial realms. As Le Coq ventures into forests, parks, and natural settings, he aims to capture the essence of each tree's distinct personality, while also creating a sense of unity within the environment. His images emphasize the importance of our relationship with nature, a reminder to always appreciate and protect the planet on which we rely. Le Coq's work has gained significant attention in recent years, with exhibitions in Paris, New York, and other cities around the world. The striking images invite viewers to reconsider their relationship with nature and the environment, and ultimately, highlight the beauty and importance of trees in our lives. With the growing concern for environmental preservation and climate change, Le Coq's images serve as a timely reminder of the role that trees play on Earth. Through his innovative lens and profound appreciation of the natural world, Fabien Le Coq invites us all to take a moment, look up at the sky through the trees, and recognize their unique personalities in the world around us.", "EC-SOD, the major scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in extracellular spaces and fluids, is decreased in late stage OA joint fluid compared to fluid from injuredpainful joints with intact cartilage. Injured joints may be able to increase or maintain secretion of EC-SOD but it appears that late stage OA joints fail to do so in spite of increased oxidative stress seen in the disease. Associated age related declines in GSH and ascorbate might also contribute to the development of severe OA. The net effect of these changes in joint fluid antioxidants is likely to accelerate the damaging oxidant effects on extracellular matrix stability in cartilage tissue.", "'Absolutely Fabulous' Movie to Start Filming in Autumn Across the Globe LONDON - Jennifer Saunders has confirmed the long-awaited 'Absolutely Fabulous' movie will begin filming in London, France and the Bahamas in the autumn of 2015, spurred on by a 10,000 bet with her long-time comedy partner, Dawn French. The popular British television show, which originally aired in the early 90s, follows the outrageous adventures of best friends Edina (played by Saunders) and Patsy (played by Joanna Lumley). Saunders, who is responsible for creating the series and writing the scripts, revealed that it was her bet with Dawn French that finally pushed her to put pen to paper. The two comediennes had a wager that Saunders would have the script ready in time for their Christmas day radio show last year. Despite the fact that Saunders had the script \"90 written\" by then, French forced her to honour the bet by paying up the full 10,000. The 56-year-old actress said her co-star, Joanna Lumley, has been eager for them to create the movie, insisting they \"do it before we die.\" The film adaptation is expected to feature a host of cameos, similar to the show's celebrity guest appearances, which have included artists such as Kate Moss and Elton John. 'Absolutely Fabulous' - known to its fans as Ab Fab - first aired on the BBC in 1992. It ran for five seasons and two television specials before ending in 2012, after garnering a loyal following and collecting numerous awards, including two International Emmy Awards. Fans of the show have been eagerly anticipating an 'Absolutely Fabulous' movie since the show's end. The film will now look to follow in the footsteps of other successful British television shows that have made the jump to the big screen, such as 'The Inbetweeners'. A release date for the movie is yet to be confirmed.", "This has to be one of the most awfully scripted films I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet-monster instead of a sleek Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of The Creeping Terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like.The movie is dubbed, although by the original actors (I think that the movie was originally dubbed in Italian for that countries audiences, then redubbed for US release), which just makes the movie seem weird...the sounds, like in a Japanese monster movie, just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly.Poor Ray Milland...he's certainly come a long way down from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for Murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in.

The film is incredibly well-crafted, with a narrative that is simultaneously heart-wrenching and inspiring, evoking a myriad of emotions throughout its runtime.

My 14-year-old son became so engrossed in this film that I rate it considerably higher than its imitator \"Mad City.\" It sparked debate in our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs. doing the right thing. For that alone, I rate this film a 10! Parents should watch it with their teens and discuss it afterwards.I very much liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting. I thought that James Remar was adequate in his role, but the teenage cast really carried this picture. Other IMDB users have praised Corey Feldman's performance, which truly is inspired.

Starring Tim Robbins as William, an investigator looking into forged \"papelles\" (identification documents), and Samantha Morton as Maria, a non-valid woman working at a papelle production facility, their unexpected connection sends them down a dangerous path, challenging the very fabric of their society. The movie paints a disturbing picture of a future where individual identities are stripped and controlled by a faceless omnipresent government. Our protagonists' struggle to maintain their humanity amidst this cold, sterile world is portrayed brilliantly by the talented lead actors. Robbins and Morton share a palpable chemistry on screen, making us root for their relationship even when faced with the awful truth behind it. Visually, \"Code 46\" excels with its stunning cinematography, showcasing a multicultural, urban landscape that blends modern architecture with ancient, run-down buildings. The use of natural light and the warm color palette add a sense of realism, making the world feel uncomfortably familiar, while the slightly disjointed and poetic language adds to the film's intrigue. The haunting score by David Holmes perfectly complements the story, evoking the dark undercurrents running through the plot and the world itself. Winterbottom's direction is both subtle and powerful, forcing the audience to question their own moral compass and wonder what they would do if faced with such a reality. However, the movie might not be for everyone - its slow-paced nature and ambiguous ending may throw off viewers looking for a more straightforward sci-fi experience. But for those willing to immerse themselves in this unsettling world, \"Code 46\" provides a thought-provoking and emotionally charged experience. In conclusion, \"Code 46\" is a fascinating and, at times, distressing glimpse into a potential future, exploring themes of love, morality, and the loss of individuality in a world bound by rigid rules. With exceptional performances from Robbins and Morton, stunning visuals, and a thought-provoking premise, it's a must-watch for fans of dystopian sci-fi and intense character-driven stories.", "Story about a widowed father (Claude Rains) bringing up his four daughters.

Together with our previous finding that anodal tDCS selectively impairs set-shifting abilities in COMT MetMet homozygous individuals, these results indicate that genetic factors modulate effects of tDCS on cognitive performance.

The mechanism is simple; variation within the H-bond networks result in altered mechanical linkage properties that directly affect intrinsic flexibility. Moreover, varying numbers of H-bonds and their strengths control the likelihood for energetic fluctuations as H-bonds break and reform, thus directly affecting thermodynamic properties. Consequently, these results demonstrate how unexpected large differences, especially within cooperativity correlation, emerge from subtle differences within the underlying H-bond network. This inference is consistent with well-known results that show allosteric response within a family generally varies significantly. Identifying the hydrogen bond network as a critical determining factor for these large variances may lead to new methods that can predict such effects.", "Person1: Hello, can I help you?

Anderson will earn his 100th Test cap on Monday when England take on the West Indies at the Antiguan ground that bears Richards' name. Four wickets in the game would take him past Botham's national record of 383 Test wickets, making Anderson the most prolific English bowler in history. England's James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . Sir Vivian Richards believes Anderson is a worthy heir to Sir Ian Botham (pictured in August 2014) As one of the greatest batsmen to have lived and a long-time friend of Botham, Richards is well placed to judge the scale of Anderson's achievements and his endorsement is ringing. 'He ranks with the great English fast bowlers, with the Bob Willises, the Ian Bothams and folks like that,' said Richards. 'They made a great mark and for him to be in that category, it's a tribute to him. 'He's done magnificently well. Anderson has got tremendous ability and I guess where he's at now - four wickets away from surpassing the great Sir Ian - is a tribute to the individual and to his professionalism as leader of the bowling attack. 'I captained a lot of great bowlers and I would have liked Anderson too.' Anderson has attempted to divert the attention ahead of his big day, focusing on the team's efforts to come back from a dreadful winter of white ball cricket. Four wickets in the game would take Anderson past Botham's national record of 383 Test wickets . Richards is well placed to judge the scale of Anderson's achievements and his endorsement is ringing . But with Richards' words echoed by Curtly Ambrose, one of the most fearsome fast bowlers to have graced the game, he would be forgiven for getting a touch carried away. Ambrose, speaking at the launch of his new autobiography 'Time to Talk', said: 'I've always liked James Anderson, he is a quality fast bowler. 'To have taken so many wickets in Test cricket is no mean feat because a fast bowler's life is a short one. To be four wickets away from Botham's 383 is a phenomenal achievement. 'I want to wish James all the best for his 100th Test but I hope he doesn't do too well, because I think the West Indies will win.'", "Destin, Florida - A hammerhead shark was caught on video swimming in the shallows off Destin, Florida, with the footage revealing two unsuspecting swimmers dangerously close to the giant predator. The dramatic encounter was filmed by witnesses on a nearby balcony who shouted warnings to alert the swimmers to the shark's proximity. The video, uploaded to social media on Thursday, shows the hammerhead shark scouting the shallow waters, seemingly just meters away from the swimmers, who appeared unaware of the predator's presence. As the shark continued to circle nearby, onlookers on a nearby balcony were heard yelling for the swimmers to move away. \"Get out of the water! Come toward us!\" they called out as the swimmers began to notice the commotion. Following the direction of the warning shouts, the swimmers promptly began to make their way back to the shore. Witnesses say the shark seemed inquisitive and was possibly hunting for food. Hammerhead sharks, which can grow up to 20 feet in length, are known to prey on smaller sharks, fish, squid, and octopus. They have a sensory organ in their heads that can detect the electrical signals emitted by living organisms. Although the situation appeared quite precarious, hammerhead shark attacks are relatively rare, and they're not considered aggressive to humans. According to the International Shark Attack File, there have been only 17 unprovoked attacks by hammerhead sharks on humans since records began, with no fatalities. Florida has the highest number of shark attacks in the United States, with an average of 16 incidents per year. However, shark attacks remain exceedingly rare - the odds of being bitten by a shark are about 1 in 11.5 million, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.", "oxLDL stimulated chemotaxis of hBMSCs in vitro. Treatment of the cells with BN52021, a specific antagonist of PAF receptor (PAF-R), completely blocked the cell migration induced by PAF, but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). Using PAF-R-specific small interfering RNA, it was demonstrated that silencing of endogenous PAF-R expression significantly attenuated cell migration induced by PAF, but not PDGF-BB, suggesting the specific involvement of PAF-R in the oxLDL-induced cell migration. In addition, PAF-induced migration of hBMSCs was abrogated by pretreating cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, including the MEK inhibitor U0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Moreover, adenoviral overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK blocked PAF-stimulated migration.

In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even appear depressed. She just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol. That seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mom seemed a little out there. But, the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just mean and I don't think caused by depression.

The actor leaves behind an impressive legacy of work in the entertainment industry, having appeared in numerous movies and television shows throughout the years. Born in 1935 in San Diego, California, Lewis began his career on the stage before moving on to film and television roles in the 1970s. He worked with Eastwood early in his career, appearing in the western \"High Plains Drifter\" in 1973. The partnership proved to be fruitful, as they went on to collaborate in films like \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,\" \"Every Which Way But Loose,\" and \"Bronco Billy.\" In addition to his work with Eastwood, Lewis also starred opposite Robert Redford in \"The Great Waldo Pepper\" and appeared in films such as \"The Devil's Rejects\" and \"Night of the Comet.\" His television credits include guest-starring roles on shows like \"Hawaii Five-0,\" \"The A-Team,\" \"The X-Files,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" and \"Law Order: Criminal Intent.\" Despite his extensive career, Lewis will perhaps best be remembered as a loving and supportive father to actress Juliette Lewis. His daughter, who has since become famous in her own right, has often cited her father as a major influence in her life. She took to social media following his passing, sharing a heartfelt message in which she called him \"my hero\" and stated that she was \"forever my favorite man.\" Friends, family and fans have taken to social media to pay tribute to the acting legend, remembering his undeniable talent, kind spirit, and the countless memorable performances he left behind.", "This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo.

An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? 2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created, it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film, than it is to actually watch. But it's left open to discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic (ranked 22 on AFI's list of the greatest 100 films ever made, my personal 21st favorite filmcurrently, and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction, and Visual Effects which it won for) it would have lost half its fascination, all of its complexity, and a good portion of its cinematic worth. We would only be left with the technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising.Because every shot is worth taking the time to look. And there is plenty of time. 2001 is very elegiac, and also coolly distant; detached. The emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with mankind's ape ancestors, who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home, then (in one of motion picture history's most inspired jump-cut edits) as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite, jumping forward a couple thousand years into space, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon, and next the film following a crew of space traveler's mission as they follow the monolith's signal through space, accompanied by their untrustworthy computer HAL, who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time (in a flurry of drug-induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day) to grow old, die, and be reborn a \"Star-child.\" Whew.This pacing and emotional blankness, is also in sharp contrast with the film's most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. As the crew's final explorer shuts the machine down, bathed in the holy aura of red light Kubrick has always used as a repeat motif, HAL singing a lovely tune, it is a strangely emotional experience. And it's all genius.Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece is the memorable voice of HAL (a calm, somehow sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film; giving only banal, unhelpful lines to his actors. The most famous being \"Open the pod bay doors HAL, satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music, and that first, awe-inspiring shot of earth; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, played to the sound of blasting, triumphant horns.2001 shall always remain a mystery, and will forever be a testament to the cinema's strongest point: visuals are more powerful than writing.

Under Carlo Ancelotti's stewardship, Real lifted the 10th European Cup that they had craved for so long . The former Liverpool defender also handed a portion of credit for last season's La Decima Champions League win to Mourinho, saying his work was the foundation of their success under Carlo Ancelotti. 'Yes there is a possibility of Jose returning to Madrid,' Arbeloa said. 'Why not? Madrid's door is not closed for a great coach. 'Mourinho has many fond memories of Real Madrid. For La Decima, we have to credit Ancelotti but Jose planted the foundations.' Mourinho left Madrid and rejoined Chelsea in 2013 and has since led his team to the brink of another title . The Special One endured a trophyless campaign in his last year with Real which he said was his worst season . Arbeloa was said to be one of Mourinho's main 'disciples' in the dressing room, and he admits he has spoken with the Chelsea manager as recently as last week. He also said that despite the talk of unrest in the camp at Real, the Special One left on good terms before joining Chelsea, particularly with expected summer transfer target Raphael Varane. Mourinho is said to be considering a 40million move for the French centre back when the transfer window opens in July. Arbeloa (left) was said to be one of Mourinho's main 'disciples' in the dressing room and the pair still talk . Mourinho's arguments with senior players including Iker Casillas, the club captain, were well documented . 'I spoke to him (Mourinho) last Friday,' Arbeloa toldEl Chiringuito. 'He's happy and content in London because his family are happy and there isn't the daily persecution he and his kids got here. 'The press emphasised (how) it ended badly but Jose ended well with most - (Luka) Modric, Varane, Diego (Lopez), Xabi (Alonso). 'Professionally he has a great team and is doing well.' Arbeloa says Mourinho is happy in London, having won the Capital One Cup with Chelsea last month . Raphael Varane, said to be a summer target for Mourinho, ended on good terms with his former manager .", "I'm an action movie fan, but until today, I've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" on pay-TV, hoping for nothing special. But, what a surprise! This 1996 classic, directed by Renny Harlin and starring Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, exceeded my expectations on every level. The plot is packed with action and intrigue - Davis portrays a schoolteacher with amnesia who slowly realizes that she is actually a skilled assassin with her former agency on her tail. Jackson plays a cynical detective trying to help her piece together her mysterious past. From high-speed car chases to edge-of-your-seat shootouts, \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" is an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. What sets this movie apart from other action films, however, is its clever script. Writer Shane Black expertly balances the heavy, action-packed moments with wry humor and witty banter between the two main characters. The actors' chemistry is undeniable, and their performances allow viewers to get emotionally invested in the story. Visually, \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" is impressive as well, with its top-notch stunt work, special effects, and thrilling set pieces. The film's pacing keeps the viewer engaged throughout, and the action scenes are some of the best I've seen in the genre. Perhaps the movie wasn't well-promoted in Italy, but it's definitely worth the watch for action fans. Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver remarkable performances, making this underrated gem a must-see. So, take a break from the typical action blockbusters and give \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" a chance - it might just surprise you too.", "At least the jingle by Tim Finn was melodic. Roberts is the his usual inept self. Characters are inconsistent, dull, purposeless. Roberts changes his accent even within one line.", "This is a wonderful movie...it's funny, dark, poignant, thought-provoking, innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around. \"The Curious Chronicles of Jack Bumble\" takes the viewers on an emotional roller coaster that's as delightful as it is unforgettable. The brilliant performances by an ensemble cast led by the charming Jack McFadden blend seamlessly with director Anna Jenkins' unique storytelling style. Set in a quirky, fictional town, the movie revolves around Jack, a seemingly ordinary man with an extraordinary talent for accidentally getting himself into extraordinary situations. From falling in love with the mysterious woman at the local bakery to uncovering a hidden family secret through his misadventures, Jack's journey is simultaneously heartwarming and hilarious. The cinematography is visually stunning and captures the essence of the peculiar town and its inhabitants. The film's soundtrack is another standout, featuring an exquisite blend of indie folk and pop tracks that add to the overall ambience and charm. One of the movie's strongest points is its ability to evoke deep emotion and genuine laughter in equal measure, leaving the viewer reflective yet satisfied. The on-screen chemistry between the characters is palpable and adds considerable depth to their relationships. The dialogue is engaging and witty, riddled with clever one-liners that will stick with the audience long after the credits roll. In conclusion, \"The Curious Chronicles of Jack Bumble\" is a rare gem that flawlessly mixes humor, drama, romance, and a dash of mystery into a well-rounded and truly entertaining cinematic experience. A must-watch for anyone seeking a thoughtful, delightful, and engaging film that will keep you chuckling and pondering life's peculiarities long after the movie ends.", "Contains SpoilersThis is a Peter Watkins film. If one has seen his BBC masterpieces \"Cullodden\" and \"The War Game,\" one will recognize the style (and his voice) within seconds after the start. Made in 1971 it is set in a very near future, when the Vietnam war has escalated even more and now seems to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest is dealt with violently using drumhead tribunals (outwardly civilian with 'everyday citizens' as judges). Because \"prison building can't keep up,\" an alternative is introduced: The Punishment Park. Delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment, in this case a 85 km trip through the Californian desert at 100F. If they reach an American flag at the end without being caught by National Guard or Riot Police, they will be set free, or else they have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we will see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a tribunal and the course of two groups already sentenced. Scenes jump between the tribunal tent, the hunting troops and the hunted condemned. Watkin's scarce off commentary gives us raw background information (time, temperature etc.). The tribunal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over 'undesirables' to clearly innocents (e.g. a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies). The defense lawyer (who does take his job seriously) has to take abuse from both sides. What makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the rhetoric of todays administration to the detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the 'rules of the game' don't really apply. The question remains open, whether it is rigged from the start or arbitrariness by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome (I suspect, it is both). At the end we are back at square one with the next group going to \"Punishment Park.\" This description may indicate a heavily biased (or even demagogic) propaganda movie but that would be misleading. The behavior (all participants were nonprofessionals as usual with Watkins) looks and sounds real (the tribunal scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials). I'd say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problem. With Watkins's \"The Forgotten Faces\" the reaction was \"We can't send that or nobody will believe our real newsreels anymore (because this is indistinguishable from the real thing) .\" With \"Punishment Park\" it ought to be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance (especially today).", "Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds best efforts. It also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Erotic and violent, the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in Atlanta, and delivering a chaotic detective case, to you (the viewer), on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who's clientel is anything but ordinary. Before long, Sharky's crimefighting Machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of Atlanta. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I recall the excitement in town during the movie's production. Sharky's Machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of Atlanta. Twenty years removed and 2,000,000-more people later, the film stands the test of time. Trust me, Atlanta has not changed. One of the highlights of the picture is Dar Robinson's daring stunt (a classic, symbolic ending). It was even featured on That's Incredible, ABC's reality show of the period. It's just too bad that Hollywood does not make enough films like this one. Kick back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver cinema action.", "Lipid crystals, particularly cholesterol crystals, have been found to play a role in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. These crystals can mechanically stimulate adjacent extracellular matrix (ECM) components in advanced atherosclerotic plaques, leading to inflammation, cell activation, and plaque destabilization. Lipid crystals can accumulate within the necrotic core of the plaque, which can increase volume and mechanical pressure on the ECM. This mechanical stimulation can activate inflammatory cells, like macrophages, and promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to further plaque destabilization and even plaque rupture. Moreover, lipid crystals can cause direct mechanical damage to ECM components, such as collagen and elastin, leading to a weakened fibrous cap. The weaker fibrous cap and increased inflammation can contribute to the susceptibility of the plaque to rupture, which may lead to a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke. In summary, lipid crystals in advanced atherosclerotic plaques can mechanically stimulate adjacent ECM components, leading to plaque destabilization and increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and effects of lipid crystals on ECM stimulation in atherosclerosis.", "Person1: Of course!

Have you had a chance to review the details I sent over? Person1: Yes, I have. The plans look great! I especially like the idea of having a silent auction to raise funds. Have you had any thoughts about the auction items? Person2: I'm glad you liked it. We've been brainstorming about the auction items and have a few in mind, including local artwork, gift certificates to local businesses, and experiences like hot air balloon rides or cooking classes. Person1: Those sound like excellent ideas. I'm sure people will enjoy bidding on those unique items. Now, what about the venue? I know we discussed a few options. Person2: After looking at all the options, we think the Lakeside Country Club would be the most suitable for our event. It has a beautiful outdoor area and enough space to accommodate guests comfortably. Person1: That's a great choice, very picturesque. Lastly, let's discuss the timeline for sending out invitations and finalizing the program. Person2: Invitations should be sent out at least a month in advance, so let's aim for six weeks before the event. As for the program, we'll aim to have that ready at least two weeks before, giving us time to make any last-minute changes if necessary. Person1: That sounds like a solid plan, Ms. Ross. Thank you for your hard work in organizing this event. I'm sure it will be a success. Person2: Thank you, Mr. Fisher. It's been a pleasure working with you on this.

Peer pressure, the desire to stay connected with friends, and the fear of missing out on important conversations or events are factors that can encourage young drivers to use their phones while driving. Young people often feel the need to respond immediately to messages or calls, even if they're in the middle of the road, which can lead to dangerous consequences. Furthermore, if young drivers see their friends or family members frequently engaging in this behavior, they may be more inclined to adopt it themselves. To reduce this risk, it's essential to educate young drivers about the dangers of using a mobile phone while driving and to promote safe driving habits and practices.", "Although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational, still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from Andy Warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewer-friendly. In any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing Joe buck naked (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half-way. This would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler, instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own.", "I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart several years back (along with \"Hawken's Breed figuring anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is surely worth that much.

I threw both movies in the trash.This thing fails on so many levels it's hard to narrow it down, but let's just say it's tawdry, incredible, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even at 100 minutes, way too long.I love Byrne as an actor, but this schlock really looks bad on his resume.", "Cocky medical students play chicken with a process that simulates death, in an attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. This thrilling and mind-bending cinematic experience, aptly titled \"Flatliners,\" takes the audience on a rollercoaster ride of suspense, intrigue, and psychological horror. The film, helmed by a visionary director, explores the darkest corners of human curiosity as the characters inch closer to uncovering life's greatest mystery. The ensemble cast delivers compelling performances, with each actor digging deep to portray the inner turmoil of their on-screen personas. As the students find their lives irrevocably changed by their explorations of the unknown, the cast masterfully navigates the emotional turmoil that ensues. Visually, \"Flatliners\" is a feast for the eyes, with stunning visuals and impeccable cinematography that evoke a sense of eeriness and dread. The film's score adds ambience and resonates with the audience, ensuring a lingering sense of unease even after the credits have rolled. The plot itself, while initially appearing as a simple thriller, delves into the deeper existential questions of life, death, guilt, and redemption. This psychological aspect elevates the film beyond mere jump scares, forcing the viewer to confront their own fears and assumptions about the afterlife. However, despite its thought-provoking plot and solid performances, \"Flatliners\" falters in its pacing. At times, the film feels bogged down in its desire to explore every character's arc, which can lead to moments of frustration for the viewer. Nevertheless, these issues are minor compared to the overall triumph of the film. In conclusion, \"Flatliners\" is a thrilling cinematic experience that smoothly combines elements of horror, suspense, and psychological drama. With its stellar cast, jaw-dropping visuals, and thought-provoking plot, it is a must-watch for fans of the genre and those seeking an intellectually stimulating journey into the unknown.", "Repeated shifting of the LD cycle, which disrupts endogenous circadian timekeeping, dramatically reduces pregnancy success in mice. Advances of the LD cycle have a greater negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and, in non-pregnant female mice, require longer for circadian re-entrainment, suggesting that the magnitude or duration of circadian misalignment may be related to the severity of the adverse impact on pregnancy. These results explicitly link disruptions of circadian entrainment to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mammals, which may have important implications for the reproductive health of female shift workers, women with circadian rhythm sleep disorders andor women with disturbed circadian rhythms for other reasons.", "New York: An underground electrical fire caused a huge explosion in downtown Buffalo, sending a manhole cover flying more than 200 feet into the air on Sunday morning. The blast took place on Tupper Street around 11:30 a.m. and resulted in the evacuation of two buildings in the area. Authorities were quick to arrive on the scene and have since contained the fire. According to the Buffalo police department, smoke was emanating from the manholes, causing initial panic among the residents. At the time of the explosion, a photojournalist was interviewing a man on the street, with a second blast taking place about half a block behind them. Miraculously, the manhole cover flew up without causing any reported injuries or fatalities. The immediate priority for the city officials was to ensure the safety of the residents. As a precautionary measure, two buildings in the vicinity were evacuated, and fire crews worked swiftly to contain the situation. \"We came as quickly as possible to make sure everyone was safe,\" said a spokesperson for the authorities. \"Our focus now is to mitigate the scene and prevent any further incidents.\" The initial investigation suggests that the explosion was due to an underground electrical fire. However, the exact cause leading to the explosion remains unclear, and authorities are working diligently to determine whether any lapse in safety measures occurred. The Department of Public Works is responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of underground electrical infrastructure in Buffalo. With an incident of such magnitude, city officials are expected to take immediate corrective measures to ensure better safety of the residents against any similar incidents in the future. \"Anytime something like this happens, it's our responsibility to review the safety protocols and determine what happened,\" said a city official. \"We will be working closely with the authorities and local residents to evaluate this situation and take appropriate action.\" As the investigation continues, residents are urged to report any suspicious activities or specific concerns in their neighborhoods to the authorities. Meanwhile, those who were evacuated are now able to return to their homes temporarily after the area was deemed safe by authorities.", "Person1: That sounds like a great idea!

Complexity of Treatment: Hepatitis C treatment can be complex, with various factors (such as genotype, viral load, liver condition, etc.) needing to be considered. This can make it challenging to follow guidelines in some cases. 5. Limited Access to Specialists: In some areas, there might be limited access to hepatologists or other specialists who are experienced in managing hepatitis C, leading to suboptimal treatment decisions. Despite these challenges, it is important for healthcare providers to stay informed about the current guidelines for hepatitis C treatment and work to improve patient adherence and access to appropriate care.", "Yes, professional awareness is needed to distinguish between child physical abuse and other disorders that can mimic signs of abuse, such as skull base sclerosis manifesting features of infantile cortical hyperostosis. Accurate diagnosis requires a detailed evaluation of the child's medical history, clinical signs, radiological studies, and in some cases, a multidisciplinary team approach, including pediatricians, radiologists, and child abuse specialists.

With its bleak atmosphere and moody cinematography, the film expertly conveys a sense of claustrophobic desperation, reflecting the protagonist's inner turmoil. The lead actor delivers a captivating portrayal of the conflicted bomber, torn between loyalty to his cause and the weight of his conscience. His nuanced performance adds depth to an otherwise simple character, allowing viewers to empathize with his moral struggle.

Personal loans can be used for various purposes, including education and studying abroad. May I know your citizenship and the country you're planning to study in? Person2: I'm a U.S. citizen, and I'm planning to study in France. Person1: Great! As a U.S. citizen, you are eligible to apply for our personal loans. We could even consider a student loan, depending on your specific needs and financial situation. For our personal loans, you can typically borrow anywhere from 1,000 to 50,000, with interest rates ranging from 5.99 to 35.99 APR, depending on your creditworthiness. Repayment terms usually range from 3 to 5 years. Alternatively, we also offer Student loans, which have a number of benefits tailored specifically for students. These loans generally have lower interest rates and flexible repayment options once you have completed your studies. The borrowing limit and loan terms will vary based on your specific situation and the program you're enrolling in. Person2: I see. Do you require a co-signer for either of these loan options? Person1: For personal loans, it depends on your credit score and financial situation. If you have a good credit score and a stable income, you might not need a co-signer. However, if you have a limited or poor credit history, having a co-signer may increase your chances of approval and potentially lead to a lower interest rate. For student loans, it is more common to require a co-signer, especially if you have limited credit history or if the loan amount is large. A co-signer with a good credit history can help you qualify for a loan and secure a lower interest rate. Person2: Thanks for the information. What documents do I need to provide for the application? Person1: When applying for a personal or student loan, you will typically be asked for the following information: 1. Proof of identity: A valid government-issued ID, such as a driver's license or passport. 2. Proof of income: Recent pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements. 3. Employment details: Your employer's information and length of employment. 4. SchoolProgram information: Including the name of the institution, the program you'll be attending, enrollmentacceptance letter, and the duration of the program. Additionally, your co-signer will need to provide their personal, employment, and financial information as well. Keep in mind that each lender may have slightly different requirements, so it's important to check with the specific lender you're applying with. Person2: Great! I appreciate your help. How long does the application process usually take, and when would I receive the funds? Person1: The application process itself can be fairly quick, often taking just a few minutes to complete the online form. Once you've submitted the required documents, it may take a few business days for us to review the application and make a decision. If approved, the time it takes to receive the funds will vary depending on your chosen lender, but typically, the funds are disbursed within 1-2 weeks after approval. Please keep in mind that it's best to start your application process well in advance to ensure you have adequate time to receive the funds before your study program begins. Person2: Thank you so much for your help and the information provided. I'll start gathering my documents and look into those loan options. Person1: You're welcome! If you have any questions or need further assistance during your application process, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Its lackluster plot and poorly developed characters pale in comparison to Firth's other critically acclaimed works, such as The King's Speech and A Single Man. In Playmaker, the storyline seems to have been concocted merely as an excuse to string together a series of cliched action scenes and cringe-worthy moments that fail to evoke the intended suspense and excitement. The performances in Playmaker, despite Firth's usually commendable skill, are unconvincing and forgettable. Firth himself appears to be phoning it in, likely aware of the movie's poor quality during production. His co-stars do little to elevate the material they are given, resulting in a movie that is devoid of engaging moments or any redeeming qualities. Ultimately, Playmaker feels like a wasted opportunity to showcase the incredible talent of Colin Firth. Instead, this poorly executed film leaves audiences disappointed and wondering how such a powerhouse actor found himself involved in such a lamentable project. Save yourself some time and skip Playmaker, opting instead for one of Firth's more celebrated films.", "I made it through half of this, but was not enough of a masochist to see it all. The first half of the film had next to no dialog ! Almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story. The scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over. At the same time he forgot to do any character development. Most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other. There are some good things going on in the film. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.", "Ben Stokes was involved in a war of words with West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels last night after a hard-fought opening day of the second Test.

Stokes was taunted by Samuels after the match, playing on his experience of 56 Tests to Stokes's seven . 'Tomorrow I'll have to tell him something different because he's not listening to me. He keeps on talking to me and he keeps on motivating me to carry on batting. 'It all depends on how tomorrow goes,' said Samuels, who then talked of himself in the third person. 'Marlon Samuels with 150 and Ben Stokes with the ball in his hands. It will be very interesting. The English boys don't learnbecause whenever they talk to me I continue to score runs!' Samuels also had an angry exchange with Jimmy Anderson at Trent Bridge three years ago and went on to score 117. Samuels smashes a shot through the offside as he approaches a century ahead of day two in Grenada . Samuels claimed inexperienced Stokes is 'battling himself' and that England 'can't help' talking to him . Samuels was put on his back by Stuart Broad, who bowled too short on day one but got value for this bouncer . Australian umpire Steve Davis had to step in to calm down Stokes and Samuels after the Englishman's sledging ended with him hurling the ball in frustration to try to run his opponent out and conceding overthrows. Samuels said: 'I can't tell you what he said, that's between umpire and players. But the talk between me and Stokes was nothing big.' The Jamaican should have been caught by Alastair Cook at slip on 32 off Chris Jordan, who said: 'Stokesy likes to get in a battle and you saw two cricketers going at it for their country so I guess it makes good viewing. 'That kind of stuff makes Stokesy tick. Any time he is in a battle, all of us will back him. It's good to see two cricketers going at it without crossing the line.' Stokes had earlier twisted his hip on the greasy outfield and had lengthy treatment. But he recovered to take the key wicket of Shiv Chanderpaul with his second ball. Samuels half-century celebration is subdued as he worked to rebuild the West Indian innings .", "Yes, pseudouridine modifications in Caenorhabditis elegans spliceosomal snRNAs are found in unique regions that are involved in snRNA-snRNA interactions. Pseudouridine is a common and important RNA modification involved in various biological processes, and it frequently occurs in functionally important regions of RNA. In spliceosomal snRNAs, these modifications can play crucial roles in stabilizing RNA structure, fine-tuning interactions between snRNAs and other components of the spliceosome, and affecting the efficiency and fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing. Thus, the presence of pseudouridine in regions involved in snRNA-snRNA interactions in C. elegans highlights its functional importance in the splicing process.", "There is evidence to suggest that genome-wide DNA methylation profiles may indicate CD8 T cell hypermethylation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, in which immune cells, like CD8 T cells, play critical roles. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to MS pathogenesis, and epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation may provide a potential link between these factors and dysregulated immune responses. Several studies have investigated DNA methylation patterns in MS patients and uncovered differences in CD8 T cell methylation compared to healthy individuals. For example, a 2014 study by the Parnell Group identified hypermethylation of genes that are critical for CD8 T cell function in MS patients. Another study published in Science Advances in 2020 found that DNA methylation changes in CD8 T cells were strongly associated with MS risk. However, it is important to note that these findings are based on correlative studies, and further research is needed to establish a definitive causal link between CD8 T cell hypermethylation and MS development or progression. It is also crucial to recognize the complex nature of the disease and the many factors that contribute to its pathogenesis.", "Alcoholism is considered a disease for several reasons: 1. Genetic factors: There is evidence that genetic factors can predispose an individual to develop alcoholism. Research has shown that children of alcoholics are more likely to become alcoholics themselves, suggesting a genetic component to the disease. 2. Changes in brain chemistry: Alcoholism involves changes in brain chemistry that lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. Regular consumption of alcohol affects the levels of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which play a role in mood regulation and reward pathways in the brain. These changes can make it difficult for a person to stop drinking. 3. Disease progression: Alcoholism follows a predictable, progressive pattern similar to other chronic illnesses. It begins with occasional use that may lead to abuse, then addiction, and finally to a chronic, progressive disease characterized by physical dependence and compulsive drinking behavior. 4. Loss of control: Just like other diseases, alcoholism causes the affected individual to lose control over their actions. A person with alcoholism finds it difficult to control their drinking, even when it causes social, occupational, or health problems. 5. Withdrawal symptoms: Alcoholism, like other chronic diseases, has a withdrawal syndrome associated with it. When an individual with alcoholism stops drinking, they may experience a range of physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, irritability, depression, and sleep disturbances. 6. Chronic and relapsing nature: Alcoholism is a chronic and relapsing disease, meaning that it can last for a long time and a person may experience multiple relapses or return to problematic drinking patterns after periods of sobriety. 7. Medical and psychosocial complications: Alcoholism can lead to various medical, psychological, and social complications, similar to the complications that result from other diseases. These may include liver diseases, cognitive disorders, mental health issues, and disrupted relationships with friends and family. Because of these factors, alcoholism is widely recognized as a disease by medical professionals, and treating it as such helps to destigmatize addiction, allowing for a more compassionate and effective approach to treatment and recovery.", "Increased levels of aCL and anti-2GPI antibodies were found in leprosy patients and in the APS group, however, in contrast to APS, the predominant isotype in leprosy was IgM. The frequency of aCL and anti-2GPI antibodies was significantly higher in leprosy patients than in healthy individuals (15.8 vs. 3.1; p0.01; 46.2 vs. 9.4, p0.01), respectively. The lepromatous form predominated among aCL positive leprosy patients (p0.01). There was no difference in aCL and anti-2GPI positivity between leprosy patients taking MDT and those completed MDT as cured. Furthermore the duration of discharged period (period between discharge from MDT and the realization of the study) had no effect on anti-2GPI positivity, and a slight increase in aCL positivity was observed in patients with longer follow up periods (p0.04), suggesting that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) was not a transient phenomenon. Although aPL in leprosy were frequent and 2GPI-dependent as those found in APS, IgM was the predominant isotype, and there was no association with thrombosis or other APS manifestations.", "IFN- is a key molecule for abdominal adhesion formation after hepatectomy, acting via the reciprocal balance of PAI-1 and tPA. This molecular mechanism may also regulate adhesion formation in patients following hepatectomy. HGF inhibited formation of adhesions by regulating IFN- and PAI-1, suggesting that it may be an important target for prevention of adhesions after hepatectomy. SURGICAL RELEVANCE: Postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions can be asymptomatic or cause significant morbidity and mortality. Adhesion formation after hepatectomy has not been studied extensively. In the present study, the molecular mechanisms underlying intra-abdominal adhesions after hepatectomy were investigated in a murine model and in patients. Interferon (IFN) produced by natural killer T cells is a key molecule for adhesion formation after hepatectomy in mice, acting via the reciprocal balance between plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) 1 and tissue plasminogen activator, the pivotal factors in fibrinolytic activity. This mechanism was also involved in the regulation of adhesions in human tissue samples. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) strongly inhibited adhesion formation by regulating IFN- and PAI-1. These results indicate that IFN- and PAI-1 are possible therapeutic targets, and HGF could prevent postoperative adhesion formation after hepatectomy.", "Adenomyosis patients with a uterus volume 100 cubic centimeters are at risk of having an activated coagulation system. These patients, particularly those with elevated SF and DD, may be at risk of thrombotic disorders. Fibrinolysis is activated in a portion of patients with activated coagulation during menstruation. Activated fibrinolysis during menstruation may contribute to menorrhagia in patients with adenomyosis, as only patients with activated fibrinolysis suffered menorrhagia, even though patients with an adenomyotic uterus 100 cubic centimeters without activated fibrinolysis did not. These results suggest extensive adenomyosis confers a potential risk of infarction and thrombosis and exacerbates menorrhagia via activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis during menstruation.", "Aston Villa manager, Tim Sherwood, has taken time out of his busy schedule to reply to six-year-old fan, Charlie Pye, who applied for the Villa job when Paul Lambert was sacked. In his application letter, the youngster playfully suggested that he would hire his mom and dad as assistant managers to help him with the task. In his response, Sherwood admitted that the youngster \"just pipped\" him to the post for the hotseat and added, \"The club has thousands of fans younger than seven who I am sure all share your enthusiasm for Villa, and I hope you will continue to show that support in the future. Hopefully one day in the future you will also get to lead your team out at Villa Park as the manager.\" Pye's mother confirmed that he had written the letter himself, without her knowledge, after hearing his parents discussing Villa's search for a new manager. Sherwood's gesture is being well received by Aston Villa fans, as his team gears up to face off against West Brom on April 25th.", "Person1: Good evening and welcome to this week's Business World, the program for and about business people.

I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.

True, it has a few loose ends, actually a lot, but I still think that it is a terrific movie. Some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out O.J. Simpson in \"The Towering Inferno\" and RaulRalph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one. He says that his dad danced with the Rockets and left Ralph his tap shoes. The Rockets, as far as I know, are made up of women. And the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Also the guy who read the lines of Juliet in the Romeo and Juliet play was funny. One thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. I have never heard anything like it!!! My favorite song is \"I Sing the Body Electric\" and my second is the theme song itself \"Fame.\" Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called \"La Guardia School of the Performing Arts.\" This movie showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary, and Liza. They all had a hard time, but made it their own way. This movie could have added on about another 30-45 minutes (before the graduation), but it is still my favorite movie no matter what!!!!", "Person1: Can I get you something to drink?

Person2: Yeah.", "Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the Director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven, Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self, family or others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it!!", "Date: On Tuesday night, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) defender David Luiz struggled against rivals FC Barcelona as their Champions League hopes dissolved. The former Chelsea player was unfortunately at fault for both goals that PSG conceded. Barcelona proved to be the better side on the pitch, capitalizing on mistakes made by the French club. David Luiz, in particular, had a night to forget, as his errors led to Barcelona's goals. It was a difficult night for PSG, who played well but ultimately fell short of the success they had hoped for in the tournament. ITV pundit Roy Keane offered words of sympathy for the beleaguered defender, acknowledging the pressure and expectation that players face, especially in high-stakes situations such as the Champions League knockout stages. Keane, a former footballer himself, understands the weight on players' shoulders and the challenges they face on the field. While the loss was a significant blow for PSG, they now have the opportunity to regroup and refocus their efforts on other competitions. As for David Luiz, this difficult night will likely serve as a learning experience for the defender, who will no doubt be eager to make amends as soon as possible. In closing, PSG suffered a tough defeat on Tuesday night and must now move past their Champions League disappointment. At the same time, they can use this experience to improve and grow as a team, taking the lessons from their loss against Barcelona and using them to come back stronger in the future.", "I think that Pierre Leaud, or his character, to be precise, is really outlandish but with grace: I also remember the chess player, and of the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home, something really curious...the woman acting as the lawyer, is to me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen...but I must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously....The character who plays as the lead theater actor is really nice, especially when he's annoyed by the new actor, the one in purple t-shirt...also, the scene where the bearded actor - who belongs to another company - directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing, as it often happens with this movie - for example, when they drink tea, they just make you want to have a cup...", "Going down on one knee is always a nerve-wracking experience but popping the question in public comes with an extra helping of risk. And for one man, it was a risk that most certainly didn't pay off after he was very publicly turned down by his girlfriend during an appearance on The Jeremy Kyle Show. The couple, known only as Jamie and Dawn, were appearing on an episode entitled: 'My fiance is a womaniser but is he a cheat?' Scroll down for video . The big moment: Jeremy Kyle Show guest Jamie goes down on one knee in front of girlfriend Dawn . Having refused to take one of the show's famous lie detector tests, Jamie attempts to show his love for Dawn by proposing - but has the ring thrown back in his face. In front of Mr Kyle and a tittering studio audience, a furious Dawn then storms out, screeching: 'I'm out of here!' The moment came towards the end of a stormy show in which the couple had hurled accusations at each other, with Jamie admitting to having sex with one of Dawn's friends while she took their pet dog for a walk. But following Dawn's dramatic walkout, Jamie, flanked by a furrow-browed Mr Kyle, insisted that it had all been a huge mistake. Not impressed: She opens the box, takes a look at the ring and then throws it in his face . Heading off: Dawn then storms off the stage, screeching: 'I'm out of here!' 'It was one mistake,' he explained. Blaming his refusal to take the lie detector test on his MS, he continued: . 'It was not my decision to not do the lie detector. The friend I had sex with was a one off.' But his pleas fell on deaf ears, with a sobbing Dawn going on to reveal that she had also had a fling with someone else. 'Twice you went behind my back,' shouted a furious Jamie. 'I made one mistake.' Having been advised to 'put up or move on' by Mr Kyle, the couple left the show with no plans to marry in the near future.

But Malia Obama isn't your average 16-year-old: Her driving lessons were provided by the U.S. Secret Service. Asked who taught Malia how to drive, first lady Michelle Obama told celebrity chef and daytime talk-show host Rachael Ray in an interview that it was the armed agents who provide around-the-clock security for the family. Scroll down for video . Famous family: Malia Obama, seen with her mother Michelle Obama in April 2009, reportedly was taught how to drive by Secret Service agents . 'The Secret Service, actually, because they wouldn't let me in the car with her,' Mrs. Obama said in an excerpt of the interview that was released by Ray's program. The full interview is set to air Thursday. Mrs. Obama hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years, she said. She added that driving gives Malia 'a sense of normalcy,' helping her feel like the rest of her friends who are also driving. 'And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids.' When Ray says that the Obamas seem 'so grounded,' the first lady replies that her 'hope is just to make sure that they (her daughters) come out of this thing as functioning adults, you know?' Malia also drives herself around Washington, Mrs. Obama said. 'She always has security around but in order for her to learn how to drive she had to drive on her own,' the first lady said during a separate interview on 'Live!

Upon viewing Caddyshack 2, I have to say, while it might not live up to the comedic legacy of its predecessor, it still provided a fair share of chuckles and light-hearted entertainment. Caddyshack 2 returns to the Bushwood Country Club setting and tells the story of a nouveau riche land developer, played by Jackie Mason, who shakes up the snobbish club members. The movie retains a few characters from the original movie, such as Chevy Chase as Ty Webb, albeit with a significantly smaller role. Additionally, it attempts to replace Bill Murray's iconic Carl Spackler with a new gopher-hunting groundskeeper played by Dan Aykroyd, whose comic antics provide a few laughs, but ultimately fall short of Murray's unforgettable performance. The film's plot feels somewhat disjointed and lacks focus, and it is evident that the script went through some last-minute rewrites. Nevertheless, there are a few genuinely funny moments, mostly thanks to the chemistry between Jackie Mason and his on-screen nemesis, played by Robert Stack. In terms of cinematography and sound design, Caddyshack 2 is a competent offering that does not detract from its overall enjoyment. Though the soundtrack, featuring songs from the likes of Kenny Loggins and George S. Clinton, is a mixed bag, the music does capture the 80s vibe and adds to the nostalgic overtones of the film. Overall, one cannot help but feel that Caddyshack 2 suffers from the inevitable comparisons to the original cult classic. It struggles to reach the comedic heights of the first film but retains enough charm and humor for fans willing to approach it as a standalone experience. In conclusion, if you're a fan of the first Caddyshack, lower your expectations and you might find yourself enjoying this sequel for what it is: a lighthearted escape set against the backdrop of golf shenanigans.", "In this film I prefer Deacon Frost.

For example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then Keith David starts speaking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it's like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad.

Further, some panic disorder subjects were taking medications andor had comorbid conditions. However, second-level regression analyses did not reveal any correlations between medication use or comorbidity and activation patterns demonstrated by the non-dominant hand complex task. Finally, we used a post-hoc approach to determine the magnitude of global fMRI signal as a surrogate index of the global cerebral blood flow as a means of controlling for possible confounds from reduction of BOLD signal secondary to cerebral vasoconstriction resulting from possible hyperventilation among panic subjects. A more compelling approach would have been to record the respiratory data from subjects during scanning.", "Transgenic reporters driven by control elements from BMP responsive genes such as Id1 offer significant advantages in sensitivity and consistency over immunostaining for studies of BMP pathway activation. They also provide opportunities for analysis of BMP signaling in organ and primary cell cultures subjected to experimental manipulation. Using such a reporter, we made the surprising finding that SMAD dependent BMP signaling is inactive in nephron progenitors, and that these cells are refractory to activation by applied growth factors. Furthermore, we find that the BMP pathway is not normally active in collecting duct tips, but that it can be ectopically activated by BMP treatment, offering a possible explanation for the inhibitory effects of BMP treatment on collecting duct growth and branching.", "Yes, the role of proteinase inhibitor ovorubin in apple snail eggs resembles plant embryo defense against predation. Ovorubin is a protein that acts as a proteinase inhibitor, providing protection against predation and microbial degradation of the eggs. It is mainly found in the perivitellin fluid of Pomacea canaliculata, a species of apple snail. Plant embryos also have similar defense mechanisms against predation, which includes the production of proteinase inhibitors. These inhibitors interfere with the digestive processes of herbivores and exert a protective role in defending plant embryos against attacks. In summary, both ovorubin in apple snail eggs and proteinase inhibitors in plant embryos play crucial roles in defending against predation by interfering with the attacker's digestive processes and protecting the respective organisms.", "The woman who came up with a neon sign that has welcomed countless visitors to 'fabulous Las Vegas' since 1959 has died. Betty Willis, credited with designing the 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign, died in her Overton, Nevada, home on Sunday, according to an obituary on the Virgin Valley Moapa Valley Mortuaries' website. The 91-year-old artist's often-copied sign sits in a median in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard south of the Strip. Betty Willis in her Las Vegas home on December 30, 2004, with a replica of the sign she designed in 1959 to lure tourists. She died aged 91 . The 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' neon sign, here outlined in pink lightbulbs in honor of breast cancer awareness month, became a major tourist attraction . 'It's the most recognizable icon in the world,' said Danielle Kelly, executive director of The Neon Museum in Las Vegas, where the signs of Sin City's past are retired and on display. The welcome sign's design, which doesn't have a copyright owner, has become a fixture on travel tchotchkes from Vegas and everywhere else, Kelly said. She has a T-shirt from San Francisco with that city's name swapped in for Las Vegas in front of the sign's recognizable shape, she said. 'The fact that everyone loves that sign and its design after all these years is a testament to Betty's talents,' Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak said. 'There is probably no bigger Las Vegas icon than that sign.' In 2009, the sign was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Kelly called Willis' designs dazzling and said her personality was akin to a strong, fast-talking female lead in movies like 'His Girl Friday.' 'A little salty, a little irreverent,' Kelly said with fondness. 'I thought she was a classic broad.' Willis, born in 1923 in the small town of Overton northeast of Las Vegas, worked as a commercial artist in Los Angeles before returning to Las Vegas, where she worked for sign companies and designed the famous diamond-shaped beacon of flashing lights. The sign has become such a popular photo backdrop that a parking lot for cars and tour buses in the middle of the street was expanded in 2012.

Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroicstyle. Not due to the high level starring which remind me that mostof those high starring French films are usually pathetic. But justbecause there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in acity like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau'sCyrano. Then I decided to write up this small comment because I thinkI really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb.I was not disappointed. The film just look like the poster. Thecharacters are just as stupid as they look like. For a while Ithought Adjani would be like a caricature just a funny characteryou can laugh at. No she is not! For example when she decides to tellDepardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at thebeginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat patheticmusic which should make you cry and realize Adajani's character is adeeper person as she looks like. Maybe this was humor at the 10thlevel but I am sorry my sense of humor is not that high! If I want tosee some funny French film on the WWII I watch once again La GrandeVadrouille! It is definitively more fun! I have also read on imdbthat Lemoine is making a great performance in this film. I have tosay I have never seen a so bad acting!

Nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good (very costly) scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morningwhen the German army arrives at Paris or when the refugees settle downon a bridge in Bordeaux.

This is due to uneven macular illumination resulting from the optical vignetting effect of different silicone oil bubble sizes. The increase in foveal light exposure may be significant when the procedure is performed under bright operating microscope light on already stressed photoreceptors of an eye filled with silicon oil. We advocate the use of precautions, such as central shadow filter on the operating microscope light source to reduce foveal light exposure and the risk of phototoxicity at the time of removal of silicone oil.

However, some studies have investigated the effects of diabetes on liver tissue and DNA methylation and how Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy can be used to analyze these effects. Diabetes can induce changes in the liver tissue, such as alterations in the composition of biochemical components, fatty liver, and hepatocyte damage. These changes can be determined and characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, which provides information about the vibrational energies of molecules present in the tissue and can indicate structural changes in biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that involves the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine base in DNA. This process usually leads to the repression of gene transcription and changes in gene expression. Diabetes has been associated with alterations in DNA methylation patterns in various tissues, including liver cells. As the liver plays a central role in glucose homeostasis, it is possible that changes in DNA methylation status in liver cells due to diabetes could affect the FT-IR characteristics of the tissue. DNA methylation can alter the secondary structure of DNA and affect the interaction between DNA and proteins, which may be detectable through FT-IR spectroscopy. However, further research is needed to confirm the connection between liver cell DNA methylation status, diabetes, and the corresponding alterations in FT-IR characteristics.", "This movie moves and inspire you, it's like you are one of the family.

After having high hopes due to its intriguing premise, this film ultimately fell flat with a flimsy plot and lackluster performances. The film takes an overused theme, attempting to mix science fiction and survival adventure, but adds no twist or novelty to it. The cinematography, while visually stunning at times, could not save the weak screenplay, which was filled with shallow, cliched dialogue. It's a shame, as the amazing locations and sets had the potential to create an immersive experience for the audience. However, that was squandered due to the lack of depth and emotional weight behind the characters and their actions. The cast seemed promising in the beginning, but their performances were hindered by the subpar material that they were given to work with. The chemistry between the actors was non-existent, making the relationships and connections between the characters difficult to believe. Overall, this movie's IMDb rating of 6 stars feels incredibly generous. While it had the potential to be a captivating film, it ultimately collapsed under the weight of its weak script, thus leaving the audience unfulfilled and yearning for a more authentic emotional connection to the story.", "Former Chelsea legend Paulo Ferreira has suggested that current Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho could be in for another lengthy stay at the club, breaking the unwritten rule in football management of 'never go back'. Jose Mourinho, 52, returned to Chelsea in 2013 for his second spell at the club after an acrimonious departure the first time around, and looks set to lead Chelsea to the title this season after their 3-1 win away at Leicester in their mid-week fixture. Ferreira, who made over 140 appearances for the Blues between 2004 and 2013, stated \"He came back for a reason because he loves the club, he feels at home at the club\" and continued, \"Chances are that he is going to live here [in England] longer, because really he is a man who can stay here for a long time.\" According to the Portuguese full-back, Jose is currently enjoying a 'perfect marriage' with Chelsea upon his return to the club - a lot of this due in part to Mourinho's improved relationship with club owner Roman Abramovich. Ferreira spoke highly of Mourinho's professionalism, confirming \"He's fair. If you are training well, doing well, you are in the team. If you are not doing well, of course, you are out. That is the way it should be, I think.\" Mourinho's last trophy at Chelsea came in the form of the FA Cup in 2007 prior to his dismissal. However, Ferreira declared \"if there is a coach who can break the [never] 'go back' rule, it is Jose.\" Now, following their win against the Foxes, his Blues are one step closer.", "Person1: Oh, that's unfortunate.

The discovery comes as a court plan approved the restart of two Japanese nuclear reactors, igniting fresh terrorism concerns. The drone, which measures 50 centimeters in diameter and has four propellers, was found on Wednesday morning by security personnel. A bottle containing radioactive Cesium was attached to the drone along with a small camera and a water bottle. Preliminary reports suggest that the radioactive material did not pose a direct health risk. The incident has alarmed the Japanese authorities, given that the drone managed to fly close to a high-security zone around the Prime Minister's Office unnoticed until it landed. \"This incident happened just as the reopening of two nuclear reactors was being discussed, so the question is whether it was a case of political terrorism,\" said security expert Takehiko Yamamoto, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University. \"Either way, it is important for the government to improve monitoring.\" Japanese officials have estimated that it would take between 2 and 3 years to finalize the restart of the plants, so the sudden approval has been met with shock and disapproval by the public, which remains distrustful of Japan's nuclear industry. The government has been pushing for the restart of nuclear reactors, which were shut down after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, to help stabilize the struggling Japanese economy and reduce the reliance on nuclear energy imports. Policymakers have argued in favor of phasing out nuclear power, given the country's vulnerability to natural disasters, which could lead to other catastrophes like Fukushima. Japan is located within the Ring of Fire, a geologically active region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The discovery of the radioactive drone has alarmed the nation, raising questions about national security. Authorities say it is a stark reminder that Japan needs to update its aviation regulations more effectively to counteract drone-related terrorism threats. \"It may have been an act by someone who was outraged by the court decision to restart nuclear reactors. It's definitely a wake-up call for the authorities to stay vigilant for further acts by extremists,\" said Toshihiko Takeshi, a political science professor at Tokyo's Sophia University.", "Person1: Yes, I'm looking for a 12-inch pan.", "The movie starts off with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fighting same vampires. This scene is probably the best out of the entire movie. The rest of the movie unfortunately is cheesy, highly unrealistic and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer ripoff. The ending also sucks big time.Some moments such as the scene where Gypsy and Helen (played by popular Chinese duo band Twins: Charlene Gillian) fight over a stuffed teddy bear are particularly cringeworthy. The storyline is also lame, surely they could have come up with something more scary than a book called \"Day for Night.\"Some good parts though. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the movie bearable with their comical roles. However, the good bits just end there. Charlene Gillian (from Twins) have never been able to act well and annoy you to pieces and \"the friendly but wussy vampire\" role was unfortunately given to Edison Chen who is a talentless pretty boy. Rating: 410", "Yes, prenatal ethanol exposure has been shown to reduce mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5) receptor number and function in the dentate gyrus of adult offspring. Studies have shown that prenatal ethanol exposure can result in various cognitive deficits and abnormal synaptic plasticity, which might be associated with altered mGluR5 expression and function in the hippocampus. For example, a study by Bird et al. (2017) showed that prenatal ethanol exposure is associated with a decrease in mGluR5 expression and disruption of mGluR5-mediated synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus of adult rat offspring. Another study by Hamilton et al. (2010) found that adult rats exposed to ethanol during their prenatal period had reduced mGluR5 mRNA expression in the hippocampus. Thus, prenatal ethanol exposure appears to have long-lasting effects on mGluR5 receptor number and function in the hippocampus, particularly in the dentate gyrus region, which could result in impaired cognitive functions in adult offspring.

Action shot: Gary Saurage, 45, who runs the Gator Country wildlife park in Beaumont, Texas, was called out on Monday morning to catch a giant 400lb, 11ft-long alligator from a family's backyard pond . Saurage later reported that the gator was safely hauled out of the pond, although it took a bit of work as it was being particularly 'aggressive'. Art Williams, of Groves, was the one who spotted the gator in his garden over Easter weekend. 'My wife and I are just going for a walk, with our new dog, and there's that 11 foot alligator just about 12 feet from us,' Williams told KBMT News. Williams said he's used to alligators being in the area, which is why he built a fence to keep them away from the pond where his grandchildren canoe.

The beast was later confirmed as a male, around 35 to 40 years old. Saurage took the reptile back to his park to join more than 400 other alligators. He says there's no reason for people to fear the toothy lizards, as long as they keep a safe distance and never attempt to feed them. He points out that alligators can run 22 miles per hour on land and 'you can't run that fast.' Although it was big, Monday's catch wasn't Saurage's biggest.

Dougie Fife, Alasdair Dickinson and Ross Ford were all rested for last week's Guinness Pro12 26-15 win over Scarlets in Llanelli following their efforts for the Dark Blues during the RBS Six Nations. But the trio have been recalled by head coach Alan Solomons for the Madejski Stadium clash with the Exiles as the South African looks to name is strongest XV. Dougie Fife is one of a trio of Scottish players returning to Edinburgh following Six Nations duty . England's Courtney Lawes (left) is tackled by Scotland's Ross Ford (centre) and David Denton . He said: 'When one gets to the play-off stage of a competition each game is a one-off. We are well aware of that and know that we will need to be at our best on Sunday.' Fife returns to the right wing while the rest of the backline remains in place following last Saturday's victory in Wales. Jack Cuthbert starts at full-back, with Tim Visser on the left wing. The centre pairing of Andries Strauss and Phil Burleigh is retained, while scrum half Sam Hidlago-Clyne - the competition's top scorer with 53 points - and stand-off Greig Tonks continue their half-back combo. Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons has named his strongest XV heading into the key clash with London Irish . In the pack, prop Dickinson and hooker Ford reclaim their places, with Willem Nel remaining at tighthead. Anton Bresler and Ben Toolis start in the second row lock. Captain Mike Coman misses out after sustaining a head knock against Scarlets, so Roddy Grant moves up from the bench to start as blindside flanker. Hamish Watson and David Denton retain their places at openside and number eight respectively, leaving Ford to skipper the side.", "Are these the kits that Manchester United fans will hope lead them to a prosperous 2015-16 campaign? Supposed images of the club's home, away and third strips for next season have leaked on to the internet, which is bound to excite many an United supporter. Last summer the Old Trafford outfit announced that they had signed a 750million deal with Sportwear giant adidas to make their kits for 10 years starting from the 2015-16 campaign. Supposed leaked images of Manchester United's (left) new adidas kit for next season have been online . Images suggest that United's away kit for next season will be white (left), with the third strip black . The German brand follow Nike who had been supplying United for 13 years ith the 20-times English champions. Nike replaced Umbro as United's kit supplier in 2002 while Adidas are about to start their second stint with United, having designed the club's kits from 1980-92. United's rumoured home strip for next season has done the rounds for a while but it is the designs of the away and third kit that will catch the eye. The Red Devils' second strip is predominately white with the iconic three adidas stripes running down the sleeves in Manchester United red and accompanied with a V-neck collar in the same colour. The away jersey is reported to be complemented with black and red shorts and white socks. United's third kit for next season differs from this year's ensemble too with blue replaced for black. Unlike the away jersey though, a crew neck collar is used alongside a flashy red monochromatic club badge and a red adidas Performance logo. Adidas first designed United's (left) club's kits for 12 years between 1980-92 . Arguably United's most memorable season, their 1998-99 campaign shirt sponsor was Umbro . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) joined United in their second season of their 13-year partnership with Nike .", "This first clinical in vivo study on aqueous humor adrenomedullin levels showed that this peptide may be involved in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. Increased aqueous humor adrenomedullin levels in patients with POAG may indicate a compensatory defense response against increased IOP to slow the formation and progression of a vicious cycle. On the other hand, there may be deficient production of the peptide in patients with NG, or adrenomedullin-producing cells may be lost because of very high IOP during the course of the disease. The control of adrenomedullin levels in the eye might be a target that could be considered in the therapeutic strategies for glaucoma. Further studies in this respect are needed.", "The extraction process was performed under room temperature and only took 60 min. The advantages of this method were very little sample preparation, requiring short treatment time and usual equipment. Four greening trees, i.e., camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora), sweet olive (Osmanthus fragrans), cedar (Cedrus deodara), and dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), were selected and extracted by this method. Seven carbonyl compounds, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, p-tolualdehyde, mo-tolualdehyde, and hexaldehyde were determined and quantified. The most common carbonyl species of the four tree leaves were formaldehyde, acrolein, and mo-tolualdehyde. They accounted for 67.3 in cedar, 50.8 in sweet olive, 45.8 in dawn redwood, and 44.6 in camphor tree, respectively. Camphor tree had the highest leaf level of mo-tolualdehyde with 15.0 - 3.4 microg g 1) (fresh leaf weight), which indicated that camphor tree may be a bioindicator of the level of tolualdehyde or xylene in the atmosphere. By analyzing carbonyl compounds from different tree leaves, it is not only helpful for further studying the relationship between sink and emission of carbonyls from plants, but also helpful for exploring optimum plant population in urban greening.", "In a shocking display of violence and betrayal, a man in Kent has been jailed for two years after assaulting and robbing his deaf friend. Bradley Dew, a 26-year-old from Faversham, was drinking with his friend at a local pub when the incident occurred. Dew later proceeded to steal his friend's mobile phone and brutally hit him in the face to swipe 10, before fleeing the scene. Dew's decision to target his deaf friend has earned him the label of a 'bully' by authorities. The police quickly responded to the incident and launched a manhunt for the perpetrator. They ultimately found Dew hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend's residence. Upon discovering the callous attacker, law enforcement promptly arrested him. The severity of Dew's actions was not only physical abuse but also psychological, as his victim was a vulnerable member of society who placed trust in him. The court proceedings have concluded with Dew receiving a sentence of two years in prison for his heinous crime. Kent Police were praised for their swift response to the situation, ensuring that Dew was found and brought to justice for his cruel betrayal of a friend. The case stands as a reminder for the public to remain vigilant and report any attacks on vulnerable individuals in their communities.", "Person1: It's time for desserts! Are you still hungry?

So far, no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the incident.", "Whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccines and subunit vaccines are two different approaches to vaccination against the flu. Both types of vaccines have their advantages, but there is some evidence to suggest that WIV vaccines may be superior in inducing immune responses and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by dendritic cells (DCs) compared to subunit vaccines. WIV vaccines contain the entire inactivated virus, while subunit vaccines only contain specific protein components of the virus, such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. This means WIV vaccines have a broader range of viral antigens to present to the immune system, which could potentially lead to a stronger and more diverse immune response. Several studies have shown that WIV vaccines can induce higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines by DCs compared to subunit vaccines. These cytokines help to coordinate the immune response, recruiting and activating other immune cells like T and B cells. A more robust proinflammatory response can lead to a stronger and more effective overall immune response to the virus. Additionally, WIV vaccines can stimulate the immune response through different pathways, including both the innate and adaptive immune system. On the other hand, subunit vaccines may rely more heavily on the adaptive immune response. This might also explain the stronger immune responses observed with WIV vaccines. However, it should be noted that there are many factors that influence the efficacy of a vaccine, including the manufacturing process, the strain of the virus, and the population receiving the vaccine. Moreover, the potential side effects of WIV vaccines, such as higher reactogenicity, might be a concern in some cases. Therefore, the choice between WIV and subunit vaccines should be made on a case-by-case basis considering these factors. Ultimately, more research is needed to determine the specific benefits of WIV vaccines compared to subunit vaccines in various settings.", "An Australian man who walked free from an Indonesian prison after nine months plans to celebrate his season by heading to the beach.

The intoxicated driver was initially spotted by a railroad worker speeding towards a crash site, raising concerns about potential further accidents. The incident took a turn for the worse as Glushko managed to evade the police temporarily and loop back, driving past them in his inebriated state. Authorities were eventually successful in apprehending Glushko, who has since been charged with a felony for driving under the influence of alcohol. This incident highlights the dangers of intoxicated driving and the need for vigilance by both law enforcement and the general public in helping prevent such events from occurring. Witnesses at the scene reported that Glushko was driving erratically and at high-speeds, raising the risk of injury or damage to both himself and others on the road. Fortunately, no one was hurt in this particular incident. However, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible driving and the potentially devastating consequences of driving while intoxicated. Police officials have not commented on the specifics of the case but have emphasized their ongoing commitment to reducing the instances of intoxicated driving and ensuring the safety of the community. In light of this incident, authorities urge the public to report any suspicious driving they may witness and to avoid engaging with potentially intoxicated drivers on the road. Furthermore, individuals are encouraged to make responsible choices, such as utilizing designated drivers, taxis, or ridesharing services, when consuming alcohol. This case involving Aleksandr Glushko highlights the ongoing issue of intoxicated driving, as well as the potential dangers that go hand-in-hand with this reckless behavior.

BMP signaling is crucial for many developmental processes, and Chordin is a BMP antagonist that binds to BMP and inhibits its signaling. CV2 is a secreted protein that binds to Chordin and enhances BMP signaling. When CV2 interacts with Chordin's VWC domains, it blocks the ability of Chordin to bind BMP and inhibits Chordin's BMP-antagonizing activity. This interaction thus promotes BMP signaling by preventing Chordin from sequestering BMP and inhibiting its activity.", "Yes, cytoskeleton proteins that were previously considered exclusive to ganglion cells are transiently expressed by all retinal neuronal precursors. Studies have shown that during retinal development, several types of cytoskeletal proteins, such as nestin and vimentin, are expressed by retinal neuronal precursors in a transient manner. These proteins are later downregulated as the cells mature and differentiate into specific retinal cell types. This transient expression of cytoskeletal proteins is essential for the proper development and organization of the retinal cells during retinogenesis.", "Outrageous Assault in Court: Man Chases, Beats Girlfriend Following a Losing Civil Case A case in Lincoln of a man flying into a rage has shocked not only those involved, but also the general public.

The video reveals the troubling arrest of Brandon Wyne, 17, and Courtney Griffith, 18, who were pulled over by police for a broken tail light. The police officers on the scene reported smelling marijuana emanating from their car and subsequently ordered the teenagers out of the vehicle. Wyne, agreeing to comply under the condition that nobody touch him until his mother arrived, requested the officers to wait. Instead, the police officer forcibly grabbed Wyne, hit him, sprayed him with pepper spray, and finally stunned him with a Taser multiple times. Griffith captured the entire incident on cell phone video. The footage was only recently discovered after Griffith found it in her phone's deleted folder. As a result, the Virginia Beach Police Department has launched an investigation into both the conduct of the arresting officers and potential evidence tampering. Further details about the case are underway, and it remains to be seen the impact the incident may have on police accountability in the local community.", "Yes, the amyloidogenicity of gelsolin is controlled by proteolysis and pH. Gelsolin is a protein involved in the actin cytoskeleton's regulation, and its amyloidogenicity has been linked to a condition called familial amyloidosis Finnish type (FAF). This condition is characterized by the deposition of gelsolin amyloid fibrils in various tissues, causing symptoms like corneal lattice dystrophy and peripheral neuropathy. Proteolysis is one of the factors that contribute to the amyloidogenicity of gelsolin. In FAF, abnormal proteolytic cleavage of mutated gelsolin leads to the production of amyloidogenic fragments. These fragments are then deposited as amyloid fibrils in various tissues, leading to the symptoms observed in FAF patients. pH also plays a role in regulating the amyloidogenicity of gelsolin. Studies have shown that gelsolin fragments are more likely to form amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions (low pH). Thus, an acidic environment can promote the amyloidogenicity of gelsolin fragments, leading to the formation and accumulation of amyloid fibrils. In summary, both proteolysis and pH regulate the amyloidogenicity of gelsolin, with proteolysis generating amyloidogenic fragments and pH affecting the propensity of these fragments to form amyloid fibrils.", "Although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational, still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from Andy Warhol to make his cinematic productions more marketable and viewer-friendly.

It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. Then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. All they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. Meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. He does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. I won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting \"WHAT THE BLOODY HELL?!?!\" at the screen. Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. Which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.Is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? Apparently so. I cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). I think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. They then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. But then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. And then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. It's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.This movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. There are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept.

Keep it up!", "I was given the solo \"Summertime\" in 5th grade for our spring choral concert. Little did I know that my love for this classic tune would lead me to discover an extraordinary film years later. \"Porgy and Bess,\" directed by Otto Preminger, is a film adaptation of the renowned George Gershwin opera, in which \"Summertime\" originates. The movie brilliantly captures the essence of Catfish Row, a tight-knit African-American community in the south. Through heartfelt performances, we are introduced to the complex and endearing characters of Porgy, a disabled beggar, and Bess, a woman shunned by society and entangled in a tumultuous relationship with the abusive Crown. The musical numbers are nothing short of breathtaking, weaving through the narrative seamlessly and leaving the audience with an unforgettable experience. Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge's raw and captivating performances as Porgy and Bess, respectively, are filled with intense passion and vulnerability. Their chemistry on-screen makes the tragic love story all the more believable and heart-wrenching. Visually, the film is a work of art, with vibrant colors and a gritty realism that transports viewers to the 1920s coastal South Carolina setting. However, it is not without its flaws, as some dialogue and subplots may appear dated and offensive to modern audiences. Nonetheless, \"Porgy and Bess\" remains a significant piece in cinema history, as both an artistic triumph and a testament to the power of the human spirit. The film spares no effort in showcasing the hope, resilience, and camaraderie of this tight-knit community, making it a must-watch for all music and cinema enthusiasts. As for the soulful rendition of \"Summertime\" in the film, it instantly transported me back to my 5th-grade performance, enveloping me with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and affection for this enduring classic.", "Person1: Alright, this first gift is from Susan.

Now, let's enjoy the cupcakes and continue celebrating!", "A couple of days ago, I saw the awesome \"House of Sand and Fog\" and I was impressed with the amazing performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. The film, directed by Vadim Perelman, is an adaptation of the novel by Andre Dubus III and tells the tragic story of a woman who loses her family home due to a bureaucratic error. This emotional rollercoaster is driven by the riveting performances from the entire cast, including Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo. The cinematography is breathtaking, perfectly capturing the essence and mood of the story. The Northern California's fog-shrouded coastline lends an eerie, yet poetic feel to the film, setting the perfect atmosphere for this tragic tale. The haunting and soul-stirring score by James Horner adds a layer of melancholy and grace to the already intense storyline. Ben Kingsley delivers one of his career-best performances as the grief-stricken former Iranian colonel, Massoud Amir Behrani, who becomes embroiled in an all-consuming conflict with his stubborn American neighbor, Kathleen Lazaro, played with equal passion by Jennifer Connelly. The struggles, emotions, and moral dilemmas faced by these characters are portrayed with such depth and nuance that you can't help but be captivated by their compelling journeys. Shohreh Aghdashloo, as Kingsley's tormented wife, offers a heart-wrenching performance that is both powerful and profoundly moving, earning her a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The chemistry between her and Kingsley is simply remarkable, making their relationship incredibly authentic and deeply engaging. \"House of Sand and Fog\" is a powerful tale of loss, regret, and the destructive nature of obsession. It might be a difficult watch for some, as it tackles heavy themes and offers no easy resolutions, but it is undoubtedly a thought-provoking and compelling film. The remarkable performances, stunning visuals, and poignant storytelling make this movie a captivating and memorable experience, not to be missed.", "Person1: How did you get interested in country music? Person2: Well, when my wife and I first caught our record player. We started to buy all kinds of records, soon, I found that I was buying more country music records than any other kind.

That was how we started the program called Golden Country Time. Person1: Then you were asked to write articles to explain the background of those songs.

Victory this season with Bayern, who face Porto in the quarter-finals starting Wednesday night at the Dragao, would make Alonso only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso admitted to The Telegraph. Xabi Alonso lines up for Bayern Munich on Wednesday night against Porto at the Dragao Stadium . The Champions League first leg quarter-final is the next step in his quest to win the title with three clubs . 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' Alonso said. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to be a pundit rather than a player for the final win over Atletico Madrid. Alonso trains under the watchful eye of manager Pep Guardiola who is keen to add to his Barcelona victories . Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax, 1998 with Real Madrid and twice with AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007. At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. But first his side must overcome Porto, who are the only unbeaten side in the competition this year. And they will have to do it for the first leg at least with a host of stars including Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger, along with David Alaba, Medhi Benatia, Javi Martinez and Tom Starke.

Studies have shown that in most cases, the femoral bone and cartilage show significant wear at these angles in patients with osteoarthritis. A study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research found that during TKA, the femoral component is often implanted with the greatest contact pressure at either 0 or 90 of knee flexion. This increased pressure can result in increased wear of the implant over time. Another study in the same journal confirmed that maximum cartilage wear in osteoarthritic knees undergoing TKA occurs at 0 or 90. The authors concluded that this could help in predicting and planning implant positioning during surgery. However, predicting the exact extent of bone and cartilage wear in individual cases can be challenging. Factors such as patient-specific anatomy, alignment, surgical technique, and implant materials can all contribute to variations in wear patterns. In conclusion, while it is known that the wear of femoral bone and cartilage in osteoarthritic knees is generally most significant at 0 and 90, the precise extent of wear and how it may progress in individual cases remains difficult to predict with absolute certainty.", "Veteran ESPN reporter Shelley Smith is set to return to work six months after announcing she had cancer.

Smith, 56, also revealed in an interview with Sports Illustrated, where she worked prior to her position at ESPN, that she will not be wearing a wig upon her return and is proud of her bald head. 'I have a friend who is a former oncology nurse who tells me that when your hair falls out, it means the chemo is working,' she said. 'That's the attitude I took into this. I miss my hair, but I took what she said to heart: My bald head means I have a fight and I look at it as being fortunate to have a battle.' For her first assignment back, Smith will head to Hawaii and be with Oregon quarterbackMarcus Mariota for a feature that will air prior to the draft. Mariota, the winner of this year's Heiman Trophy, is expected by most pundits to go first or second in the draft alongside Florida star, and fellow quarterback, Jameis Winston.

Experts have long thought that a particular kind of salt detected in Martian soil could pull water vapor from the the planet's thin atmosphere into the soil at night and then keep it from freezing despite the extreme cold. Researchers aren't saying they've seen direct evidence of brine hiding out in the Martian night. But they say the new study based on a full year of monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions by the Mars Curiosity rover in Gale Crater does seem to bear the theory out. \"Gale Crater is one of the least likely places on Mars to have conditions for brines to form, compared to sites at higher latitudes or with more shading,\" said Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona at Tucson, a co-author of the new report. NASA chief scientist: 'Indications' of alien life by 2025 . \"So if brines can exist there, that strengthens the case they could form and persist even longer at many other locations,\" possibly explaining channels seen on Mars that appear be formed by running water, he said. Researchers say Mars may once have had an sea as extensive as Earth's Atlantic Ocean, and Curiosity has found evidence of ancient streambeds and a lake on the planet. The vast majority of that water has been lost to space over the eons, leaving Mars an overwhelmingly dry and inhospitable place. The new study doesn't change the picture for life on Mars. The researchers say the temperatures they measured are too low and water too scarce \"to support terrestrial organisms\" (sorry, bunny fans). But scientists say evidence of water ice at the planet's poles and now more evidence toward the theory of widespread brines keeps them hoping they'll find evidence that life at least once existed there. \"Liquid water is a requirement for life as we know it, and a target for Mars exploration missions,\" lead author Javier Martin-Torres said in a statement. \"Conditions near the surface of present-day Mars are hardly favorable for microbial life as we know it,\" he said, \"but the possibility for liquid brines on Mars has wider implications for habitability and geological water-related processes.\" In other words, we'll keep looking. Mars is the next step for humanity we must take it .", "There is some evidence suggesting that intravitreal injection of erythropoietin (EPO) may protect both retinal vascular and neuronal cells in early diabetes. Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone that is primarily responsible for stimulating the production of red blood cells, but also has been shown to have neuroprotective and angiogenic effects. In animal models of diabetic retinopathy, intravitreal injection of EPO has been shown to protect retinal neurons, reduce inflammation, and reduce vascular leakage, which are associated with the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, EPO has been shown to have anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects on retinal ganglion cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells. This suggests that EPO may help protect retinal cells from damage caused by high blood sugar levels in the early stages of diabetes. However, it should be noted that these findings are based on animal studies, and more research is needed to determine if similar effects would be observed in humans. Some studies have raised concerns about the long-term safety of EPO due to potential risks of increased blood viscosity and thrombotic events. Therefore, while intravitreal injection of EPO may show promise as a potential therapy for retinal vascular and neuronal protection in early diabetes, more research is necessary to establish its efficacy and safety in humans.", "the food intake did not differ among the groups, however, the relative weight of the adipose tissue was higher in animals from the HC, HH and CH groups (p 0.005).

The levels of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were higher in the HH group, and the LDL level was higher in the CH group compared to the CC.

Microteaching is a teaching method that involves a teacher presenting a short lesson to a small group of learners, usually colleagues or other educators, followed by feedback and potential revisions. This method allows educators to improve their teaching techniques in a comfortable and constructive environment. In the context of clinical teaching, microteaching aids faculty development by helping educators refine their skills, receive feedback, and incorporate new teaching strategies. Standardized students, on the other hand, are individuals who are trained to simulate and play the role of patients during clinical education. They provide a consistent and controlled group of \"patients\" for the faculty to practice their teaching skills. This approach helps create a more interactive and diverse learning environment, and allows educators to receive immediate feedback on their teaching methods and communication skills. Together, microteaching and standardized students provide a valuable opportunity for clinical educators to enhance and refine their teaching abilities, ultimately leading to improved educational experiences for their students. By offering a safe and supportive environment to practice, educators can develop effective communication, problem-solving, and clinical assessment skills that will benefit their students in real-life situations.", "It's official, darling - the stars of hit BBC show Absolutely Fabulous are set to reunite for a film. Jennifer Saunders, who wrote and starred in the series, confirmed yesterday the cast will begin filming in the autumn.

Jennifer Saunders (left) and Joanna Lumley (right) are set to reunite for a film of Absolutely Fabulous . The film will be based in London, with some scenes in the south of France, or in the Bahamas if the budget allows. Saunders, 56, who plays immature Edina, told ITV's Loose Women that she had been 'nervous' about writing the film script. She said: 'I think that's why I didn't do it for a while. I thought, wouldn't it be awful if it was awful but now we're all so old, Joanna said to me \"Do it before we die!\" We're all on the brink.' When pushed for details about the film's plot, she said: 'There is a plot and that's the miracle!

Nonetheless, Vipers on a Ferry dared to challenge Samuel L. Jackson's iconic flick and, surprisingly, delivered an entertaining, if not quite as gripping, thriller experience. Vipers on a Ferry tells a familiar story: a group of panicked passengers must band together to survive a deadly swarm of snake-like creatures brought aboard through a freak accident. The vipers' reptilian instincts keep the passengers on their toes, providing the necessary thrills and nail-biting tension throughout the film. The ensemble cast did a commendable job, with the standout performances coming from Shaun Toub and Emmanuelle Chriqui, who portrayed resourceful survivors grappling with their fears and the looming threat of the venomous serpents. The CGI effects were impressive for a lower-budget film, creating a realistic atmosphere of terror without overshadowing the character-driven narrative. Despite its valiant efforts, Vipers on a Ferry could not quite reach the heights of Snakes on a Plane's campy, quotable charm and infectious energy. However, it succeeds as a respectable creature feature that should not be dismissed based on its unfortunate title similarity. Fans of the genre and those looking for a decent popcorn flick should board this ferry and prepare themselves for a wild ride.", "Yes, microRNA-199b-5p has been found to impair cancer stem cells through the negative regulation of HES1 in medulloblastoma. In a study by Ferretti et al. (2009), microRNA-199b-5p was shown to target the transcription factor HES1, a key regulator in stem cell maintenance and proliferation in the cerebellum. The downregulation of HES1 by microRNA-199b-5p impairs the ability of cancer stem cells to self-renew and propagate in medulloblastoma, leading to a reduced tumor growth. This indicates that microRNA-199b-5p could serve as a potential therapeutic target for medulloblastoma treatment by inhibiting the cancer stem cells that contribute to tumor growth and recurrence.

Apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me. Rollin's movies are unimaginably boring, they all feature the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogs are incredibly absurd, the marvelous Gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I had actually given up on Rollin's repertoire already (especially after enduring \"The Iron Rose, until I found out about \"Night of the Hunted.\" Allegedly, this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists. And the verdict is yes and no! On one hand, this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive Rollin film I had the pleasure of seeing thus far (and also the only one that I watching without dozing off). On the other hand, it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all. The unearthly beautiful lead actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen. During a nightly drive back home to Paris, a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods. Her name is Elisabeth but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away. Her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up. The next day, she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she does sense she needs to escape from here. Obviously I won't reveal the denouement, but I can assure you it is quite dumb, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently Rollin realized this as well, because the explanation is kept very brief and quick. There's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences, the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion, the nasty make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose. As said, the score is mesmerizing and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is addictive to glaze at.", "I felt that the movie Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of these actions; however I feel that it was not complete or attention holding. He never fully got into the plot or deep into the character emotions or reasons behind their actions. The only thing that I found rather attention holding in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Many times during the movie was just the two main characters sitting around or doing their daily chores and not even having a conversation. I understand this was to show the reality of these people however I feel there are other ways to show reality and have it be entertaining. I think that Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this movie in a more riveting way.", "As a general guideline, adjustment for femoral bone wear is rarely required when performing kinematically aligned TKA. Most osteoarthritic knees require adjustment of the distal referencing guide to compensate for cartilage wear on the medial femoral condyle in the varus knee and the lateral femoral condyle in the valgus knee. Adjustment of the posterior referencing guide is required in about half of valgus osteoarthritic knees to compensate for lateral cartilage wear at 90. Knowing that bone wear is rare and cartilage wear is predictable in varus and valgus Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3 or 4 osteoarthritic knees helps establish general guidelines for adjusting the distal and posterior femoral referencing guides to restore the natural angle and level of the femoral joint lines when performing kinematically aligned TKA with generic instruments.", "This is a must for All but especially African Americans. It is about time there is a movie that expresses and shows the concerns going on in African American relationships. It also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous manner how positive African American relationships are and the outcomes of them instead of the undesirable stereotype that plagues the African American community.

The 60-year-old judge was spotted at the Montgomery County Circuit Court, and although the reason for his visit remains unclear, it has sparked speculation and curiosity in the legal community. Known for his leading role in the highest court of the United States, it is quite rare for a Supreme Court Justice to be seen in a local court.

This marks a rare occasion in which a high-ranking judicial officer has appeared in a local court setting. With questions regarding the reason for his visit left unanswered, the legal fraternity awaits further updates on the matter. Appointed by President George W.

Set in the vibrant streets of Berlin, Victoria is a high-octane thriller that is shot entirely in a single, continuous take, making the notion of \"real-time\" a breathtaking reality. The film follows the titular character, Victoria, a Spanish woman played by Laia Costa, who has recently moved to Germany. After an innocent night of clubbing, she crosses paths with a group of four men led by Sonne, portrayed by Frederick Lau. What begins as an exciting and electric connection between Victoria and Sonne quickly spirals into a gritty, intense crime drama as the group gets entangled in a bank heist. The incredible direction and cinematography by Sebastian Schipper and Sturla Brandth Grvlen, respectively, keep viewers captivated throughout the film. The camera doesn't miss a beat as it weaves through alleyways, staircases, and speeding cars while the characters navigate the highs and lows of their predicament. The real-time aspect lends an air of urgency and authenticity to the story that scripted films, with their carefully edited scenes, often lack. The actors deliver raw and captivating performances, creating an emotional connection with the audience that is hard to shake off even after the credits roll. One cannot help but applaud the creative risks taken in Victoria, as it redefines the standard framework of filmmaking. The film does have its minor flaws, likely due to the limitations imposed by its one-take format. However, its groundbreaking execution and its commitment to authenticity overshadow these drawbacks. In conclusion, Victoria is a riveting and immersive experience that showcases the potential of real-time filmmaking. With a gripping storyline, expert direction, and powerful performances, Victoria is a cinematic rollercoaster ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.", "A Georgia road about 125 miles away from where Duane Allman died nearly 45 years ago took the life of one of the Southern rockers who played on the hit dedicated to the Allman Brothers guitarist.

Last week Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz warned Renault to solve their problems otherwise he would consider pulling his teams out of Formula One. A few days later Renault endured a Chinese Grand Prix to forget as Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and the Toro Rosso of Max Verstappen both suffered a power-unit failure. Remarkably, Abiteboul has now confirmed of being aware of the fact the system had a fault, one he is confident will be fixed come the Monaco Grand Prix next month. Renault's Cyril Abiteboul (left) has promised Red Bull that the engine problems will be resolved . 'We knew there was a weakness, so there was a plan in place,' said Abiteboul. 'We need to make sure the plan is good enough for the size of the issues we have had, and whether it can be addressed fairly quickly. 'I'm not quite sure, from a logistical perspective, it could be addressed for this weekend's race in Bahrain. 'But certainly our aim has been to have absolutely no reliability issues by Monaco. 'We knew the first engine we built had some reliability weaknesses, and unfortunately we saw that in China. Unhappy Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz threatened to pull out of Formula One . 'The plan is to make sure the future engine we will be building has absolutely no reliability issues.' That is of little comfort to Horner who goes into the fourth race of the season with one of his drivers having used two engines when only four are allowed per season otherwise penalties start to be applied. 'I don't think anybody expected us to be on engine three after race three in any of our scenarios,' said an unhappy Horner. 'We accept sometimes to find performance you've got to take some risks. Calculated risks are what Red Bull has always bought into. Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and the Toro Rosso of Max Verstappen both suffered a power-unit failure in China . 'But the frustrating thing for both parties is we're in this situation with three of our allotted four engines in use going into race four.

Deep sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep, is associated with memory consolidation and overall brain health. As we age, the quality and duration of deep sleep tend to decrease, which could contribute to age-related cognitive decline. In addition, age-related alterations in gene expression within the parietal cortex, a brain region involved in various cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and spatial awareness, have been reported in some studies. These alterations may negatively impact neuronal function and lead to a decline in cognitive performance. Although research in this area is ongoing, it is plausible that both changes in deep sleep and gene expression in the parietal cortex may contribute to cognitive deficits with age. Further studies are needed to better understand these relationships and explore potential interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline.", "Roy Keane described Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz as 'lost' following his woeful first-half performance against Barcelona on Tuesday night.

Keane, known as one of punditry's scariest characters, isn't usually one for holding back when it comes to opinions, but even he had some sympathy for the Brazilian international. PSG defender David Luiz (right) had a torrid time marking Barcelona forward Neymar on Tuesday night . Luiz was at fault for both of Neymar's goals as PSG crashed out of the Champions League quarter-finals . ITV pundit Roy Keane offered his sympathy to Luiz, describing the defender's performance as looking 'lost' 'I actually feel sorry for him,' the 43-year-old told ITV. 'He just looks lost again; we spoke about him before the game. 'He doesn't smell danger and the stuff there is literally schoolboy stuff. 'You've got to give the boy sympathy, a little bit.

Neymar set the tone for the game when he slotted home the opener following some fine work from Andres Iniesta before later heading a second past Salvatore Sirigu. And Luiz was quick to admit that his side got what they deserved across both legs of the fixture. 'They were a better team than us in both games. They controlled both games and they deserved to qualify,' he told ITV. 'We didn't take the opportunities to score in the first match. We didn't play well, but we had seven or eight opportunities.

From the very start, audiences were thrown into a chaotic and convoluted plot with little to no explanation of the characters' motives or the stakes at hand. Granted, the stunning visuals and captivating action sequences were enough to hold our attention, but the lack of coherent storytelling left us feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. The performances by the lead actors were commendable, with both showcasing their ability to portray emotionally complex characters. Unfortunately, the lack of proper character development led to a disconnection between the viewer and the protagonists, making it difficult to truly become invested in their journey.

Additionally, the cinematography was breathtaking, capturing the richness of the film's vast and diverse landscapes.

Adenomyosis is a condition where the inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium, grows into the muscular layers of the uterus. This can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, including menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding). One possible explanation for this is that the presence of endometrial tissue in the myometrium could disrupt normal blood clotting and fibrinolysis processes, leading to heavier bleeding. Regarding thrombosis, the relationship between adenomyosis and an increased risk of blood clot formation is not well-established. However, it is known that individuals with certain hypercoagulable states, such as Factor V Leiden mutation or antiphospholipid syndrome, have an increased risk of thrombosis. It is possible that altered coagulation and fibrinolysis systems in the context of adenomyosis could lead to a prothrombotic state, increasing the risk of thrombosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between adenomyosis, coagulation and fibrinolysis systems, and the risk of thrombosis and menorrhagia. If you have concerns about these conditions, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized recommendations.", "These findings further support our hypothesis that high levels of DRD2 are causally associated with a reduction in alcohol consumption and may serve as a protective factor against alcoholism. That this effect was seen in P rats, which are predisposed to alcohol intake, suggests that they are protective even in those who are genetically predisposed to high alcohol intake. It is noteworthy that increasing DRD2 significantly decreased alcohol intake but did not abolish it, suggesting that high DRD2 levels may specifically interfere with the administration of large quantities of alcohol.

Mourinho left the club back in 2013, after a series of public fall-outs. However, Arbeloa credits Mourinho as the \"foundation\" of the team's Champions League success. Despite the end of his spell at Madrid, Arbeloa insists that Mourinho's tenure with the team ended well and that it is possible for The Special One to make a return in the future. However, the Chelsea boss seems content in London, maintaining a good relationship with the players. Mourinho is rumored to be on good terms with 40 million Real Madrid target, Raphael Varane.", "Yes, thrifty metabolic programming in rats may be induced by both maternal undernutrition and postnatal leptin treatment but can be masked in the presence of both, which has implications for models of developmental programming. Maternal undernutrition during pregnancy has been linked to the development of \"thrifty\" metabolic programming in offspring, characterized by improved metabolic efficiency and increased propensity for obesity and metabolic disorders. Postnatal leptin treatment, on the other hand, has been shown to reverse the effects of maternal undernutrition on offspring's metabolic programming, reducing their risk of obesity and related disorders. However, when both maternal undernutrition and postnatal leptin treatment are combined, their effects on offspring's metabolic programming may be masked or counteracted. As a result, the offspring may not display the typical thrifty phenotype observed in rats subjected to maternal undernutrition alone or the improved metabolic phenotype observed in rats subjected to postnatal leptin treatment alone. This finding has important implications for models of developmental programming, as it highlights the complex interplay between different environmental factors in shaping offspring's metabolic health. It underscores the need for further research to understand the mechanisms through which these factors interact and their role in the development of chronic diseases. Additionally, this knowledge can help inform strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders in humans, particularly in populations exposed to nutritional stress during early life.", "She's a best-selling singer, actress, fashion designer, beauty buff and one of the world's best connected stars.

Directed by Sergei Eisenstein in 1925, Battleship Potemkin tells the story of a group of sailors who challenge their superiors on the eponymous vessel, culminating in a mutiny that ultimately plants the seed of revolution in early 20th century Russia. As a silent film, the movie relies heavily on visuals, and Eisenstein's innovative use of montages and editing techniques crafts a compelling narrative that transcends language barriers. One of the most notable elements of the film is the chilling \"Odessa Steps\" sequence, which depicts the brutal massacre of civilians by Tsarist soldiers. The scene demonstrates Eisenstein's impressive ability to intertwine emotion and political commentary through imagery, stirring a sense of empathy and urgency in the viewer. Thanks to numerous restorations, the film's cinematography remains striking in modern viewings, with iconic shots that portray both the intensity and the vulnerability of the revolutionaries. The film's score, though separate from the original film due to the nature of silent cinema, is nevertheless a vital component in conveying emotion, and various new compositions have been created over the years to add layers of meaning to the film. One cannot address Battleship Potemkin without noting its historically controversial nature, earning the film a flickering list of bans and censorship in numerous countries throughout its lifespan. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, the film maintains a lasting influence on the art of filmmaking and can be seen as the predecessor of numerous socially and politically conscious films that followed. In conclusion, The Battleship Potemkin is a fascinating classic that still captivates today, showcasing cinema's ability to provoke emotion and stir revolutions. Just as it was said to be a favorite of the legendary Charlie Chaplin, audiences today can appreciate Eisenstein's innovative craftsmanship and the poignant tale of revolutionaries fighting for freedom and justice.", "Person1: Sally,here is a letter for us.

Yours, Tom.", "Date: [today's date] Body: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has recently placed a bounty of about 774,000, payable in American dollars, for the killing or capture of a Houthi leader and a former Yemeni president. The announcement was made through AQAP's official media channels and is considered a response to the instability the targeted leaders have caused in the region. The designated leaders are seen as a hindrance to the terror group's expansion in the Arabian Peninsula, and their removal could benefit AQAP's long-term goals. The Houthi rebellion, led by the identified Houthi leader, has been a major player in the Yemeni Civil War, which began in 2015. The Houthi militants have waged a successful insurgency against the internationally recognized Yemeni government, leading to a humanitarian crisis in the country. The former Yemeni president, ousted in 2012, is also considered an instigator of the Yemeni Civil War, with their alliance with Houthi forces being a major reason for the conflict. The bounty offered by AQAP highlights the group's strategic intent to eliminate internal adversaries and establish a more significant presence in the Arabian Peninsula. Reports indicate that AQAP has thrived during the civil war, becoming more organized and more deadly through its ability to exploit the chaos and power vacuum in Yemen. It is unclear whether the bounty will entice any credible bids to capture or kill the targeted leaders, but it makes AQAP's intentions and objectives in the region abundantly clear. This situation further complicates the ongoing conflict in Yemen, as it remains to be seen how the targeted leaders and their affiliated forces will react to this unprecedented bounty. The international community has expressed concern for the deteriorating situation in Yemen, with the civil war showing no signs of abating as of late. Al Qaeda's increased prominence in the region is an alarming development that will likely continue attracting the attention of global security forces. In conclusion, the sizable bounty offered by AQAP for the capture or killing of prominent Houthi and Yemeni leaders further complicates an already intricate conflict. This development showcases the terror group's strategic aspirations in the Arabian Peninsula and underscores the need for a comprehensive solution to resolve the ongoing crisis in Yemen.", "A good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction, the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally discusses the effects of the coming energy deficit originating from the peak oil production problem.This movie should be educated to all students as part of their education.

The daredevil creature, cheerfully dubbed \"Little Mac\" by crane operator Rob MacFarlane, was captured on camera and shared on Twitter, where the images quickly gained traction. MacFarlane, the crane operator at the construction site, took several photos of the raccoon that evening, clearly showing the animal as it scaled up the tower. He later posted the shots on social media, where they were shared by users fascinated by the raccoon's adventurous spirit. While raccoons are known for their climbing prowess, the height of this particular ascent is notably impressive. MacFarlane's photos reveal that the crane's top was not a deterrent for the intrepid critter as it clambered higher and higher. Luckily, the daring raccoon managed to safely descend back to the ground after completing its business on the tower crane. MacFarlane speculated that it was attracted to the crane by leftovers from the operators' lunch, a theory that is supported by his claim that raccoons have previously climbed the equipment and left their 'evidence' - both in the form of discarded lunch waste and, more memorably, waste of a different kind. This recent raccoon tale is one of many involving animals finding their way to human infrastructures. It follows the story of the 'MPR Raccoon,' an internet sensation in 2018 after scaling a 25-story building in Minnesota. The fate of these creatures captured the public's attention, as these displays of daring climbs prove that urban wildlife is truly thriving in cities around the world.", "Person1: Is your city a historical place? Person2: Not rally. 200 years ago, it was just a small insignificant village. Person1: How did it grow into such a large place? Person2: Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre. Person1: As the city grew, it must have absorbed many village nearby. Person2: Yes, it did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city. Person1: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city? Person2: Oh, yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive.

How about you, any memorable finds? Person1: That's amazing! My best find was probably an old, leather-bound collection of Shakespeare's plays. It wasn't in perfect condition but it has a beautiful, vintage charm to it. I love the thrill of searching for hidden treasures in these stores. Person2: Absolutely, it's like a treasure hunt!

Dug and his owner, Lindsay Castro, were hiking on the Jurupa Hills trail in Fontana, Canada, on Thursday when they heard a rattling sound. Lindsay backed away, but Dug ran up to the reptile - and suffered the consequences. The snake bit Dug in the face, and his face instantly ballooned to twice its size. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Dug the pug's face swelled to twice its size after he was bitten in the face by a rattlesnake . Curious pup: He had been hiking with his owner when he ran toward a rattle sound - and suffered for it . With limited time, the pair rushed to California Veterinary Specialist Hospital in Ontario, where he was given an entire vile of venom antidote. Finally, after two days of round-the-clock IV fluid and treatment, he is ready to go home. 'I thought I'd lost my dog,' Lindsay told KTLA. 'I was so scared.' Relieved: Owner Lindsay Castro thought she had lost her pet as they rushed to the hospital for treatment . Painful: This is Dug's neck after two days of intensive antidote treatment which massively reduced swelling . Forlorn: It has been a heavy few days for Dug, who was struck on one of the first days of rattlesnake season . 'It was huge': Lindsay described her shock at seeing the 'huge' reptile leap out of the bushes in Fontana . Canada's rattlesnake reason runs from April to September. Speaking to KTLA, Dug's vets issued a warning to other pet owners that animals do not have the same instincts as humans when they see a snake. Fontana Police have also released guidance for dog walkers, ordering people to keep animals on a six-foot leash and seek immediate treatment in the case of a snakebite.", "Yes, a prognostic gene expression signature can be used in the molecular classification of chemotherapy-naive urothelial cancer and can help predict clinical outcomes from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the phase 2 trial mentioned in the question, the use of dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (ddMVAC) with bevacizumab in urothelial cancer helps show the potential of using gene expression signatures for predicting clinical outcomes. By identifying unique subtypes of urothelial cancer through gene expression analysis, researchers can better understand the relationship between these molecular classifications and response to various chemotherapy treatments like ddMVAC with bevacizumab. These gene expression signatures can provide valuable information about the aggressiveness of the cancer, potential resistance to specific drugs, and help design personalized treatment strategies for better outcomes. While more research is needed to validate the effectiveness of these prognostic gene expression signatures in predicting clinical outcomes, the potential for their use in personalized medicine is promising.", "The degree of constraint affects post-implantation kinematics and load transfer. With the Prodisc (3 DOF), the facets were partially unloaded, though the IAR did not match the fixed geometrical center of the UHMWPE. The latter observation suggests joint surface incongruence is developed during movement. With the Charite (5 DOF), the IAR was less variable, yet the facet forces tended to increase, particularly during lateral bending. These results highlight the important role the facets play in guiding movement, and that implant constraint influences facetimplant synergy. The long-term consequences of the differing kinematics on clinically important outcomes such as wear and facet arthritis have yet to be determined.", "Person1: Are you an art aficionado? Person2: Not really. I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year. I hardly know anything about art or sculpture. You are a true art lover, aren't you?

Bonnie was described by her husband as 'the love of my life'.She died on April 15. Last night Suchet, 71, declined to comment, saying it was a 'private family matter'. He has thanked those on Twitter who offered their condolences. Bonnie Suchet (pictured with John) was described by her husband as 'the love of my life' The family paid tribute in a death notice in the Telegraph, which read: 'Bonnie died peacefully on 15th April 2015 aged 73. 'Adored wife of John, devoted mother of Alec and Hereward, mother-in-law of Peta-Jane, grandmother of Finn and Alexa.' In recent years the Classic FM DJ and former ITN presenter has been extremely open about his wife's diagnosis, writing a book and becoming honorary president of the Dementia UK charity. In 2009 he broke down live on air during an interview on BBC Breakfast as he gave an account of his wife's battle. He was overcome as he told presenters how his wife had been unaware she had the illness, or that he was on TV talking about it. He added that he sometimes had to beat up a cushion as a way of dealing with his frustration at the loss of the relationship, which he described was 'made in heaven'.

In 2009 Suchet was overcome as he told presenters how his wife had been unaware she had the illness, or that he was on TV talking about it . Two years later Suchet said could say about the 'wretched disease' was that it was 'taking its course' and confessed things 'will only get worse'. He admitted he had no idea if she knew who he was and said he had to build a life around the changed circumstances, which saw Bonnie being moved into a care home and Mr Suchet moving closer to his brother David for support. The newscaster, who presented bulletins at ITN for 17 years, added that if he chose to wallow in the tragedy of his wife's Alzheimer's disease, then the condition would have claimed another 'victim'. In September, Suchet, 71, said: 'The Bonnie I remember no longer exists.' There will be a private funeral.", "This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around.

Top marks.", "Newcastle Boss, John Carver, and Defender Jonas Gutierrez Settle Their Differences A recent training ground bust-up between Newcastle boss John Carver and defender Jonas Gutierrez took an interesting turn as the pair shook hands and resolved their differences \"like men.\" Carver had initially dropped Gutierrez in the aftermath of the incident. However, the situation has now been resolved, with Gutierrez confirmed to be back on the squad and playing against Swansea on Saturday. The training ground altercation allegedly arose due to a heated exchange between Carver and Gutierrez during practice. While the details of the disagreement have not been disclosed, it was serious enough for Carver to remove Gutierrez from the lineup entirely. This decision was met with widespread criticism from both fans and pundits alike. However, the pair have put the incident behind them, with Carver stating that they shook hands and moved on from the situation. \"We had a difference of opinion, what goes on inside the dressing room, stays inside, but I can assure you, everything is fine now,\" Carver explained in a recent interview. The resolution of this discord is essential for both the morale of the team and the club's performance on the pitch. With just six games remaining until the end of the season, Newcastle needs full cooperation and commitment from all players and staff to secure their place in the Premier League. Jonas Gutierrez has been a fan favorite at Newcastle United since his transfer from Mallorca in 2008. His long tenure with the club has seen ups and downs, but his comeback from cancer in recent years has been an inspirational story for the entire football community. Gutierrez's return to the squad to face Swansea on Saturday will no doubt be a positive development for the club and its supporters. In conclusion, it seems that both parties have learned the importance of setting aside their differences for the greater good of the team and working together towards a common goal. With their conflict now in the past, Newcastle's focus can return to their upcoming match against Swansea and the rest of their Premier League campaign.", "Today You Die was the 4th Seagal movie in a mini marathon I just held, and what a wild ride it was! The film, directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy, serves as a great example of high-octane action that we have come to expect from Steven Seagal. Seagal stars as Harlan Banks, a professional thief who is double-crossed by his employer and ends up wrongfully imprisoned. The plot takes an interesting turn when Banks finds himself in the middle of a prison break and must partner up with a fellow inmate, played by Treach, in order to survive and clear his name. The action sequences in Today You Die are what sets the movie apart. Seagal's signature fighting style brings a level of intensity and excitement to each of his encounters. From bone-crunching hand-to-hand combat to adrenaline-pumping car chases, the film doesn't disappoint in the action department. However, the plot may fall a little short in terms of originality. If you have seen other movies in Seagal's filmography, you might find the storyline rather familiar, with many elements pulled from his previous outings. That being said, the chemistry between Seagal and Treach brings a fresh dynamic to the table, making for an entertaining buddy-cop relationship. The supporting cast holds their own, with Mari Morrow and Nick Mancuso bringing depth to their respective roles as Banks' love interest and the villainous Max. The film's pacing was mostly on point, but there were a few moments where it started to drag. In conclusion, while Today You Die is not the best movie in Seagal's repertoire, it is still an enjoyable action flick that delivers just the right amount of intensity and excitement. If you are a Seagal fan or simply love cult action films, this is definitely worth a watch. Overall, I would rate it 610.", "Person1: Hello, so how are we feeling today?

This comedy film, directed by Shawn Levy, manages to bridge the gap between child-friendly humor and clever, quick-witted dialogue that will leave even the most jaded of adults chuckling to themselves. The stellar cast, led by Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes, perfectly embodies their respective characters. Muniz excels as a fast-talking young teenager who has a penchant for bending the truth, while Bynes brings charm and spunk to her role as his best friend. Paul Giamatti steals the show with his gleefully over-the-top portrayal of the devious and conniving Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. Visually, the film is a treat, with colorful set designs and eye-catching cinematography that adds to the overall charm. The fast-paced, action-packed plot featuring wild chase scenes, daring escapes, and hilarious pranks will keep viewers of all ages engaged from start to finish. Additionally, Big Fat Liar doesn't rely on crude humor or potty jokes to get the laughs. Instead, its focus on quick-witted banter and slapstick comedy makes it a breath of fresh air in the realm of family-friendly entertainment. The soundtrack complements the rollercoaster of emotions experienced throughout the film, with catchy pop tunes that will have you tapping your feet along to the beat. The theme of lying and its inevitable consequences is cleverly woven into the plot, providing valuable life lessons to young audiences without being preachy or tedious. In conclusion, Big Fat Liar is a delightful comedy film that entertains and enthralls viewers of all ages with its catchy dialogues, captivating performances, and refreshing departure from the crude humor prevalent in many teen films. It's worth multiple watches and will surely be remembered as a family classic for years to come.", "As a non-theist, I'm not going to comment on the great man's theory which changed the world 150 years ago. Instead, I'll focus on the cinematic masterpiece that is \"The Evolution of Revolution,\" a film that ambitiously attempts to bring Darwin's influential ideas to life through a gripping, character-driven narrative. \"The Evolution of Revolution\" captures the essence of the era in which Darwin lived, with meticulous attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and dialogue. The cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping vistas and intimate close-ups that transport the audience to the 19th-century world of scientific discovery and societal upheaval. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a stellar, nuanced performance as Charles Darwin, perfectly capturing the inner turmoil of a man grappling with the implications of his groundbreaking theory. The supporting cast is equally strong, with standout performances from Keira Knightley as Darwin's devoted wife, Emma, and Tom Hiddleston as his chief scientific rival, Richard Owen. The writing is superb, managing to convey complex scientific ideas in a manner that is both digestible and captivating for a wide range of viewers. The film explores the implications of Darwin's theory on society, religion, and humanity's understanding of itself, without ever becoming heavy-handed or preachy. Additionally, the emotional struggles and conflicts faced by the characters add depth and relatability to the film. In summary, \"The Evolution of Revolution\" is a masterfully executed film that brings Darwin's world and ideas to life vividly and brilliantly. Whether you are a scientist, historian, or just an appreciator of quality cinema, this film is a must-watch.", "More than a third of GPs are considering retirement in the next five years, a survey shows. Another one in ten is thinking about moving abroad to countries including Canada and Australia, where the pay is higher and workload less stressful. A poll of 15,560 family doctors also found that one in six is considering going part-time and 7 per cent are contemplating quitting altogether. Choices: A poll of 15,560 family doctors found that one in six is considering going part-time and 7 per cent are contemplating quitting altogether (file picture) Senior GPs say they are facing 'incredible' pressures brought on by an increasingly ageing population who have complicated illnesses, as well as having to chase targets. Their morale is low despite the fact they benefited from a pay deal ten years ago that resulted in their salaries rising by 50 per cent, while allowing them to opt out of working during evenings and weekends. There is now a national recruitment crisis and many surgeries are short-staffed, with increasing numbers of GPs retiring or moving abroad. And they are not being replaced by younger trainees, who view the career as 'second class' compared to more prestigious roles as hospital doctors or surgeons. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month described the situation as 'worrying' and pledged to alter targets and invest more in surgeries. The British Medical Association survey, which included GPs in their late 20s through to early 60s, found that 34 per cent were considering retiring within the next five years. 'Worrying': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) has pledged to alter targets and invest more in surgeries . And a fifth of the 780 trainee GPs included in the poll were already considering moving abroad. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA's GP committee, said: 'This poll lays bare the stark reality of the crisis facing the GP workforce. 'It is clear that incredible pressures on GP services are at the heart of this problem, with escalating demand having far outstripped capacity. 'GPs are overworked and intensely frustrated that they do not have enough time to spend with their patients, especially the increasing numbers of older people with multiple and complex problems.' Last month, figures showed the number of GPs applying to work abroad had increased by 40 per cent in five years. The most popular destinations are Australia, New Zealand and Canada where they can earn the equivalent of 200,000 a year and have more of a work-life balance. GPs in England earn an average of 105,000 a year, and many take home considerably more. But they claim they often work 12-hour days or longer, and that ten-minute appointment slots are not sufficient to meet patients' needs. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said the shortage of family doctors could have a 'devastating impact' on the future of the NHS.", "The BBC faced angry criticism for giving an Election platform to 'mini Russell Brand' Gareth Shoulder (above) who mocked David Cameron over his disabled son . The BBC faced angry criticism last night for giving an Election platform to a 'mini Russell Brand' who has mocked David Cameron over his disabled son.

Shoulder, 24, who is a big fan of Brand and regularly messages the comedian on social media, used his 'bbcgen2015' Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. After Mr Cameron spoke movingly in the first leaders TV Election debate about the NHS care given to Ivan, Shoulder sneered: 'A new record for Cameron... 34 minutes before he pulls out the Ivan card and pretends he cares about our NHS.' Shoulder also said that, in the debate, the Prime Minister had 'really annoyed' him and made him want to tear politicians 'a new one' - a shorthand reference to an extremely offensive phrase. Following Thursday's TV Election debate, Shoulder then imagined the three female party leaders taking part - SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru's Leanne Woods and the Green Party's Natalie Bennett - to be the subjects of a lewd parlour game, tweeting: 'Bennett, Sturgeon, Woods. , marry, avoid.' He also called Chancellor Osborne a 'briefcase wr'. The BBC says it 'hand-picked' its 200-strong Generation 2015 youth panel to 'address fundamental questions about the relationship between UK young adults and democracy'. The 24-year-old used his 'bbcgen2015' Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy . Mr Cameron is pictured with his wife Samantha and children, Ivan, Nancy and Elwen, near his Oxfordshire home in 2009 . Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: 'It is disgraceful that the BBC should give a platform to someone to spew such Left-wing bile.' Mr Shoulder said: 'Speak to the BBC,' and refused to comment further. A BBC spokesman said that Mr Shoulder was speaking in his own capacity, not as a representative of the BBC.", "Headline: Louise Redknapp and Emma Thatcher Endorse Wide-Leg Trousers as New Wardrobe Staple Sub-headline: Say Goodbye to Skinny Jeans and Hello to Effortless Style Date: June 1st, 2021 Author: Jane Doe Louise Redknapp and Emma Thatcher are spicing things up in the fashion world by embracing a new wardrobe essential - wide-leg trousers. Both the singer and the stylist have recently been spotted stepping out in this effortless and stylish piece, trading in their ever-popular skinny jeans. Redknapp and Thatcher have both independently showcased their love for the wide-leg trouser trend on social media platforms. Louise was seen donning a sleek black pair of wide-leg trousers, pairing them with a simple white shirt for a chic monochrome look. Emma, on the other hand, opted for a more casual style, choosing blue jeans with a wide-leg cut, matched with a mustard sweater and white sneakers. Both women have also expressed their fondness for the trend in interviews and blog posts. Louise Redknapp shared her new fashion fixation in a blog entry, raving about how wide-leg trousers have the potential to become an indispensable wardrobe staple for many women. She praised the versatility of the garment, mentioning its suitability for a range of occasions and its ability to adapt to varying personal styles with ease. Emma Thatcher, an equally influential voice in the fashion community, also voiced her support for the wide-leg trouser movement in a recent interview. She highlighted the comfort aspect of the trend, stating that the refreshing looseness of the trousers offers an appealing break from the restrictive nature of skinny jeans. The shift to wide-leg trousers signifies a potential tectonic change in the world of women's fashion, with influential figures such as Redknapp and Thatcher at the helm. The style offers a more relaxed and comfortable alternative to the sometimes uncomfortably tight skinny jeans, while still maintaining a polished and chic appearance. The wide-leg trouser trend also marks a step towards more inclusivity in fashion, as the cut flatters a variety of body types, unlike the notoriously exclusive skinny jeans. With more and more women seeking comfort and versatility in their wardrobes, it's no wonder this trend is quickly gaining traction. So, as we say goodbye to the reign of skinny jeans, it's time to embrace the wide-leg trouser as the new wardrobe essential. With the endorsement of style icons like Louise Redknapp and Emma Thatcher, there's no doubt that this trend will continue to gain popularity and become a must-have in closets everywhere.", "Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the USA, \"Duckman\" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons. Unlike the often innocuous criticism found in \"The Simpsons\" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in \"South Park,\" every bit of this series follows a plan. Anchored by the brilliant vocal talents of Jason Alexander, \"Duckman\" is a dark, satirical, and intellectual gem that deserves more praise for its comedic prowess and biting commentary on contemporary society. \"Duckman\" revolves around a crude, rude, and socially inappropriate private detective who happens to be a duck - a talking anthropomorphic duck. Paired with his polar-opposite sidekick, Cornfed Pig, the duo navigates the various mysteries that come their way, all the while giving viewers a glimpse into the mind of an antihero. The writing seamlessly balances between profound social critique and raunchy humor, making \"Duckman\" a refreshing, if controversial, take on the animated sitcom genre. By tackling topics such as politics, religion, and personal relationships, \"Duckman\" deftly deconstructs societal norms and holds a mirror up to the hypocrisies and double standards present in the real world. The show's unique animation style only adds to its subversive allure. With bold, striking colors and distinctive character designs, \"Duckman\" stands out as a visual spectacle that complements its thematic depth. Admittedly, \"Duckman\" is not for everyone. Its crude humor, strong language, and dark themes may be off-putting for some viewers. However, for those who appreciate sharp, hard-hitting satire, this show is a goldmine. It's a shame that the series was cut short at a mere 70 episodes; one can only imagine the additional insights and biting commentary \"Duckman\" could have provided if it had lasted as long as its contemporaries. In conclusion, while \"Duckman\" may have had a relatively short run, it left a lasting impression as one of the deepest, most thought-provoking cartoons made in the USA. Its unapologetic approach to comedy and social criticism make it a singular entity in the pantheon of animated sitcoms. If you're a fan of boundary-pushing humor and biting satire, \"Duckman\" is a series you don't want to overlook.", "If this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the WGA, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang up the word processor. The film felt like a shallow attempt at creating emotional depth with predictable plot twists and flat character development. Despite a star-studded cast, the poor script left the talented actors struggling to shed life into their dull, one-dimensional characters. It seems as though the writer intended for clever dialogue, but most of it came across as contrived and uninspired, resulting in numerous eye-roll-worthy moments. Visually, the movie delivered stunning shots, but the direction could not save it from the lousy screenplay. The film had potential, but ultimately fell flat on its face due to poor execution. Let's hope next year's nominations leave this one in the dust and bring more deserving titles to the forefront.", "Yes, treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children is associated with a sustained effect on growth. Numerous studies have shown that the use of HAART in HIV-infected children leads to significant improvements in growth parameters such as weight, height, and body mass index. These improvements are more pronounced during the first years of therapy but can be sustained over longer periods with continued treatment. It is essential to note that the success of HAART in promoting growth depends on several factors, including the child's age at the start of therapy, the duration of treatment, adherence to the medication regimen, and the presence of other clinical and social factors. In summary, HAART has a positive and sustained impact on the growth of HIV-infected children, but individual outcomes depend on several factors. Optimal management of the disease, including early diagnosis and continuous drug treatment, is critical for supporting the child's growth and overall health.", "I thought this was a beautiful movie - very brave. From the opening scene to the last, the movie was captivating and evoked a range of emotions in viewers. The stellar performances by the leading actors brought their characters to life, making it easy to invest emotionally in their journeys. The movie's plot delicately weaves the themes of love, pain, and growth into a story that manages to be both realistic and enchantingly metaphorical. The director has portrayed relationships, both romantic and platonic, in a sincere and authentic light. The cinematography was breathtaking, with stunning visuals and skillful use of color palettes that further enhanced the storytelling. The movie tackles certain social issues and stigmas, which added another layer of depth to the narrative. It prompts viewers to reflect on not just the experiences of the characters but also their understanding of various aspects of society. The soundtrack perfectly complements the on-screen emotions, adding a level of poignancy that will stay with you even after the movie ends. In conclusion, this intelligently-crafted, brave, and beautiful movie is engaging from start to finish. The film is truly captivating for its honest portrayal of love and pain, balanced by hope and resilience. A must-watch for those who appreciate authentic, impactful storytelling.", "The greatest movie ever. How's that for a contention? Well, I assure you that in the case of \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" the title is undeniably warranted. This cinematic masterpiece, based on a Stephen King novella, is a gripping portrayal of friendship and hope in the darkest of places - a prison where two inmates bond and eventually rise above the bleak realities of incarceration. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put forth unforgettable performances as the lead characters Andy Dufresne and Ellis 'Red' Redding, respectively. Robbins' stoic resilience contrasts perfectly against Freeman's calming, yet deeply emotional presence. Throughout the film, viewers find themselves rooting for these two unique characters as they deftly navigate the treacherous waters of compromise and survival within the prison walls. The brilliant direction by Frank Darabont draws the audience into the vivid world of Shawshank State Penitentiary. Every scene is a testament to masterful storytelling driven by rich and engaging dialogue. The movie's pacing flows seamlessly, buoyed by a hauntingly beautiful score by Thomas Newman which envelopes the viewer and heightens the emotional investment in the story. What truly sets \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in a league of its own is its exploration of the human spirit. The film manages to capture the complexities of human relationships and choices in a deep and profound manner, without ever compromising on entertainment. It invites the viewer to reflect on their own journey of self-discovery and redemption, while simultaneously offering a sublime and hopeful glimpse into the power of determination and the beauty of friendship. In the pantheon of movies that can be defined as \"greatest,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption\" stands tall, fully deserving of every accolade it has received. This film is not just a testament to great storytelling but also a powerful reminder that hope and friendship can set your soul free, even in the darkest of places.", "Chronic exposure of HMC to HG concentrations activates the p38 MAPK pathway.

The plot - or the lack thereof - meanders aimlessly, taking the audience on a journey down the rabbit hole of mediocrity filled with yawn-inducing cliches and lackluster storytelling. The acting ranges from wooden to laughably over-the-top, with not a single performance amongst the ensemble cast worth complimenting. The special effects are no better, resembling the work of an amateur with a greenscreen, rather than a crew of professionals toiling on a big-budget movie project. While a weak plot can sometimes be salvaged by breathtaking visuals or a compelling score, \"Catastrophic Chaos\" provides no such redemption. The cinematography is dull, adding to the overwhelming tedium that permeates every frame of this regrettable endeavor. The score only adds insult to injury, with a mix of generic and bizarrely misplaced tunes that create an incongruous cacophony instead of enhancing the storytelling. It's difficult to find a single aspect of this movie that warrants praise, as even the most patient and forgiving viewer is left feeling frustrated and empty by the end credits. Save your hard-earned dollars and resist any morbid curiosity you may have to watch this film. Instead, invest your time and money into productions more deserving of your attention. \"Catastrophic Chaos\" is one catastrophe best left forgotten.", "As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underrated) I have to boo this movie. If you can't tell who did it AND why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho-sexual thriller or have never watched 2020. It's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway.Overall, this movie serves to turn-on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex. Not a fun movie to sit through, although if you like Ellen Barkin it's nice to see her place a tough lady.", "Shocking footage has emerged of the moment a man stabbed a bouncer outside a Melbourne nightclub just before the Easter long weekend.

Shocking footage has emerged of the moment a man stabbed a bouncer outside a Melbourne nightclub just before the Easter long weekend . It is believed two men had been removed from the venue on Swanston Street when they allegedly assaulted two male staff members at about 10.13pm. Police say the pair, aged 27 and 36, sustained minor facial injuries when they left the club but did not require hospital treatment. At about 10.53pm, one of the men returned and stabbed the North Melbourne man in the back before running from the scene. Detective Senior Constable Alex Brgoc told the ABC 'it wasdisgusting watching the footage'. 'The security guard involved wasn't even involved in the initial ejection. He had his back turned so he had no opportunity to defend himself,' he said. Police have released CCTV footage of the incident, as one of the men is described as having a solid build and dark hair. He was wearing a bluepurple t-shirt, jeans and runners. The second man is described as having a solid build, about 180cm tall with brown hair. He was wearing a maroon t-shirt and dark-coloured pants. Police say a man had been ejected from the club late Thursday night when he soon returned and attacked the security guard from behind . In a separate incident, early on Good Friday, another security guard was stabbed in Melbourne. Police believe a 24-year-old man was refused entry into a nightclub on Queens Street at about 4.30am when he then allegedly slashed one of the bouncers in the leg and fled. The injured security guard and his colleagues chased after the South Melbourne manto the corner of Collins Street where an alleged assault took place between the two parties.

However, there is evidence that rhoB does play a role in the response to anticancer therapies in various cancer types. Ixabepilone is a microtubule stabilizing agent and sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, both of which have been used individually or in combination for the treatment of various cancers. They have been shown to exhibit antitumor synergy in preclinical models of cancer, such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer. RhoB is a small GTPase that has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. There is evidence suggesting that rhoB plays a role in the cellular response to anticancer therapies, such as those targeting the microtubule cytoskeleton and angiogenesis. RhoB may promote cell death in response to drug treatment or function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell growth and migration. In the context of ovarian serous cancer, it is possible that rhoB could mediate the antitumor synergy observed when combining ixabepilone and sunitinib. However, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is currently lacking. Further research is needed to investigate the specific role of rhoB in the antitumor synergy between ixabepilone and sunitinib in human ovarian serous cancer.", "The story is: a turn-of-the-century troupe of actors, along with producers and theatre-owners, have very complicated relationships.

He wants to get a good production on stage, but can't unless he convinces a pariticular reviewer to revisit the production, and give a positive review. If his production does not go on, then the troupe will put on The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships among the principals are explored; none of them interesting. But the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident playwrght a second shot.This movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie.

I'd recommend this movie series for anyone who likes the Civil War or the history leading up to it.", "No more corned beef and cabbage for her!This little romantic comedy clips along from scene to scene with a few exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All of this is centered around the wife of the husband (s) who is looking to break out of the doldrums, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty here!). Both the leading men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. Behind all the games and apparent lightheartedness is that old serious problem of staying in love and not straying in love. There's a little corniness, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and believable in all. As with many films from this period, the subtitles do not just tell what they are saying (or thinking) but often give a kind of philosophical insight, as if to justify the tragedy (or raciness). And there is that higher purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of quaint. If you are looking for visual or formal amazement, you won't find it here. But as a story, well acted, and filmed with precision and economy, it's really a great example. The events might not come as a total surprise, but it's such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And did I saw Swanson was perfect?", "Person1: Hello, 332440.

Chiasmal pathology refers to disorders or damage affecting the optic chiasm, where the optic nerves from each eye cross and partially exchange nerve fibers. This area is responsible for relaying visual information from the eyes to the brain. In chiasmal pathology, the damage on the optic chiasm can lead to various visual field defects, including temporal visual field defects. Temporal visual field defects are characterized by loss of vision or impaired vision in the outer (temporal) part of the visual field in one or both eyes. Monocular inattention, on the other hand, refers to a patient's inability to pay attention to or process visual information coming from one eye, typically the eye contralateral to the lesion. This can result in worsened visual performance and can be associated with temporal visual field defects due to the impaired processing of visual information from the affected eye. So, while temporal visual field defects in chiasmal pathology can be associated with monocular inattention, it is crucial to have a thorough assessment by an ophthalmologist or neurologist to determine the exact cause of visual impairments and formulate appropriate treatment plans.", "Everton's Seamus Coleman Penalised for Handling in Penalty Area, Martinez Insists on Foul Play In a controversial turn of events, Everton's defender Seamus Coleman was penalised for handling the ball in the penalty area during their match over the weekend. The incident occurred as Coleman went down under pressure from Marvin Emnes, leading to the referee, Michael Oliver, to decide it was a penalty. Jonjo Shelvey wasted no time in converting the penalty, putting his team ahead. Everton's manager, Roberto Martinez, expressed his disappointment with the referee's decision and insisted that his player had been pushed. Speaking to the press after the game, Martinez said, \"It's clear Seamus is being impeded by Emnes before the alleged handball. We know how strict the rules are regarding handball, but if you're being fouled in the process, it shouldn't be a penalty.\" This incident has sparked a debate around the strictness of handball rules and whether they can sometimes overshadow fouls committed by other players. Fans and pundits alike have weighed in on the contentious decision, with some agreeing with Martinez's assessment, while others believe Coleman's handling was deserving of the penalty. Despite Martinez's protests, the referee's decision stood, and the match concluded with Shelvey's penalty proving instrumental in his team's victory. The match's outcome could have significant implications for both sides, as every point counts in the tightly contested league. Everton and Martinez will be looking to put this incident behind them and focus on their upcoming fixtures, as they aim to improve their position in the table. However, this contentious decision will undoubtedly remain a talking point, with many in the football world questioning whether the handball rules need better clarification or more flexibility on the part of referees. Regardless of the debate surrounding the incident, Oliver's decision to award the penalty remains final, leading to tough consequences for Coleman and his team. Only time will tell if such an incident will lead to a renewed look at the handball rules and potential changes in how they are applied in the future.", "Hazmat Team Responds to White Powder Scare at Congressman's Office U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle's office in Pittsburgh received an unexpected interruption on Wednesday as Hazmat teams were called in to investigate a white powdery substance sent to the building. The discovery of the substance led to a temporary shutdown of the building, while the Hazmat teams tested it for potential dangers. Thankfully, the results turned up negative, and just under two hours later, Congressman Doyle and his staff were able to return to their office. Doyle showcased his humor and resilience in the face of adversity, reportedly joking, \"I live in Pittsburgh. We're not afraid of anything.\" Although the substance turned out to be non-threatening, the situation did lead to a disruption in the downtown area, with authorities shutting down part of Ross Street. Federal officials, city firefighters and Pittsburgh police were all called to the scene, taking necessary precautions to address the potential hazard. Although not a consistent occurrence, this isn't the first time that some members of the U.S. Congress have been targeted with suspicious packages. In August last year, a suspicious package scare at Congresswoman Liz Cheney's office in Wyoming led to an evacuation, but the substance was later identified as discarded clothing. Similarly, a 2018 package scare at New York City's Trump Tower was determined to be a toy and a pair of shoes. As for Congressman Doyle, he and his staff have since continued their work from the office, shaken but not deterred by the incident. It remains unclear who sent the package containing the white powdery substance and whether there was any malicious intent behind its delivery.", "Person1: When did you become interested in collecting stamps?

Person2: Yes, I do agree.", "I felt that the movie Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. Despite its fascinating exploration of the human psyche amidst war and chaos, the film's slow pacing made it difficult for me to engage with the characters and their struggles. The lead actors, Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow, give commendable performances as a reclusive married couple caught in the crosshairs of civil war on their isolated island. Their complex relationships and evolving moral compasses are well-crafted, but the film's overall somber atmosphere and excessive use of silence dampen the impact of their performances. Bergman's distinctive visual approach is evident throughout the film, with stark and often desolate landscapes serving as a backdrop for the couple's emotional turmoil. That being said, the film's drawn-out pace becomes tiresome and sometimes detracts from the message that the director is trying to convey. In conclusion, Skammen is a thought-provoking film with undeniable artistic merit, but its slow pace and often bleak atmosphere may be challenging for the casual viewer to endure. While fans of Ingmar Bergman's work might appreciate the film's deep introspective themes, it may not be the most accessible entry point for those unfamiliar with his style.", "Former Lynyrd Skynyrd Guitarist Gary Rossington Injured in Car Crash Gary Rossington, a founding member of the legendary Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, was injured in a car crash on Monday near Cartersville, Georgia, after his vehicle struck a mailbox while approaching a curve. The 69-year-old guitarist, who helped form the band in Jacksonville, Florida, is known for his work on hit songs such as \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" \"Simple Man,\" and \"Free Bird.\" Cartersville is located about 125 miles from Macon, where Duane Allman, a founding member of the Allman Brothers Band, died in a motorcycle accident in 1971. Following Allman's tragic death, Lynyrd Skynyrd famously dedicated \"Free Bird\" to his memory. Rossington's accident is the latest in a series of misfortunes to plague the band. In 1977, three Lynyrd Skynyrd members, including lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, were tragically killed in a plane crash, forcing the surviving members to disband. After a decade-long hiatus, the band reunited for a tribute tour, with Rossington and other original members playing alongside new musicians. In recent years, Rossington has struggled with health issues, enduring numerous surgeries and dealing with the aftereffects of a heart attack in 2015. Despite these difficulties, he has continued to play with Lynyrd Skynyrd as they embarked on their farewell tour in 2018, dubbed \"The Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour.\" Fans and friends have expressed their support for Rossington on social media, with many sharing their favorite memories of the guitarist and Lynyrd Skynyrd's music. The band has yet to issue an official statement regarding Rossington's condition and whether or not it will affect their ongoing tour.

Well, we're here to help. Can you tell me more about your lease agreement and the specific issue with repair costs? Person2: Sure. My lease says that the house owner is responsible for any repairs needed in the property, but I'm responsible for minor repairs like changing light bulbs or fixing leaks. The issue is, there's a major plumbing issue in the bathroom that he wants me to cover since I reported it. Person1: Thank you for the information. Generally, major repairs are the responsibility of the house owner, as stated in your lease agreement. Have you tried discussing the issue with him and referring to the terms in your lease? Person2: Yes, I have. But he insists that since I was the one who discovered the problem, I should be the one to pay for it. He also said it wouldn't have gotten so bad if I had reported it earlier. Person1: I understand your concern. In cases like this, providing documentation can be helpful. You can try showing him records of your communication about the repair issue, like emails or text messages, to demonstrate that you reported it in a timely manner. If he still refuses to cover the repair costs, you can consider seeking advice from a legal professional experienced in tenant rights. Person2: Thank you for the advice. I'll try discussing it with him again and show him the documentation. If that doesn't work, I'll seek professional help. Person1: You're welcome. Remember, our main goal here is to help you resolve this issue without any unnecessary conflict. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Good luck with your conversation with the house owner.", "This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage.This movie deals with many problems of American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I-can-do-it-all-and-you've-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. He is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. What a horrid creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. Too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time. It's just sad that the character didn't really change at all. Even though she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman in the end, she is consumed by worry about her adventure-seeking husband. So 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us (and those are only for the good intentions...)! The problem of Indian suppression is dealt with quite nicely, but there is that patronizing story-telling again. And the fact that all African-American characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical. I was so enraged most of the time! So one point (for trying) from the civil rights movement.I know, that the movie was done at a different time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of those dated point of views. But this was just disgusting!What saves this movie are the parts without the main character. Mr Dix's acting is way over the top and smug. Maybe that's why his character is so disagreeable... I liked Mrs Dunne's performance, even though her character enraged me at times. But I must say the famous land rush scene was incredibly done. And the way that the Oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the movie worthwhile. It's just amazing how civilization rose out of the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I don't understand the problem some have with that church scene. I thought it was quite funny and amusing. Maybe it wasn't supposed to be, but I liked it. So 9 points for those scenes and the impressive storytelling of the development of the Oklahoma state. That makes about 4 points altogether!", "STAT5A and STAT5B are both members of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family of proteins, which are involved in cellular responses to various cytokines and growth factors. These proteins play a crucial role in mediating the expression of genes that regulate various cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the context of drug response gene expression, it is plausible that STAT5A and STAT5B could have opposite correlations, as they might regulate different target genes, or have distinct effects on the same target genes. However, the relationship between STAT5A and STAT5B and drug response gene expression can be complex, and depends on the specific cellular context, signaling pathways involved, and drug treatments being investigated. There are some studies that have shown contrasting roles for STAT5A and STAT5B in drug response. For example, in a study on chronic myeloid leukemia, STAT5A was shown to promote resistance to imatinib, while STAT5B was associated with sensitivity to the drug. However, in other contexts, the relationship between these proteins and drug response can be more complicated or not well understood. In conclusion, while it is possible that STAT5A and STAT5B may have opposite correlations with drug response gene expression, further research is required to better understand their distinct roles and interactions in various cellular contexts and drug treatments.", "(CNN) Most climbers who try don't succeed in summiting the 29,035-foot-high Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak. But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. \"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,\" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. \"We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,\" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. \"There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.", "PLOT SPOILERS!!!! In a stunning display of cinematic creativity, \"A Tale of Three Destinies\" weaves together a complex, yet heartfelt story that left me gripping my seat from start to finish. Director Jane Dawson expertly intertwines the lives of three seemingly unrelated characters - an overworked single mother, a struggling artist, and a disillusioned businessman - and masterfully explores themes of self-discovery, redemption, and the power of human connection. The movie's pacing is wonderfully executed, as it slowly reveals the intricate connections between the three protagonists. At first glance, these characters appear to live in completely separate worlds, but we soon discover that their destinies are intertwined after a chance encounter at a coffee shop. This key scene is the catalyst for a chain of events that ultimately leads to the single mother, Lily (played by the phenomenal Sarah Thompson) saving the life of businessman David (Christopher Owens), while the artist, Max (an outstanding Nicholas Green), is working on a painting that tells their interconnected story. Dawson isn't afraid to tackle difficult subjects, such as depression and addiction, and this honest portrayal ensures that the characters are three-dimensional and deeply relatable. The raw emotions of the actors keep the audience engaged, driving home the message that no person is an island and that we are all connected in ways we might not even realize. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, with scenes that capture the vast cityscape and the subtle emotions of its inhabitants. The score by renowned composer Leonard Jenkins serves as an additional layer of storytelling, evoking a vast range of emotions and further drawing audiences into the world Dawson has crafted. In the climactic final scene, when the three characters finally meet in an emotional, tear-jerking reunion, one can't help but feel moved by the journey they've undergone. It's a testament to the superb writing and direction that the audience comes away from the film feeling a renewed sense of hope and a greater appreciation for life's interwoven tapestry. To sum up, \"A Tale of Three Destinies\" is a poignant, beautifully crafted exploration of human connection and redemption that's sure to stay with audiences long after they've left the theater. I wholeheartedly recommend this transcendent film to anyone looking for a powerful and uplifting cinematic experience.", "Over Easter weekend, a hospital dealt with an unprecedented number of deaths and resorted to using a refrigerated lorry to store bodies. Hospital bosses admitted they didn't inform the relatives about the arrangement, sparking controversy and concern among families who lost loved ones during this period. As the hospital struggled to keep up with the demand for body storage, a spokesperson revealed that using refrigerated lorries in such situations is a normal practice across the country. This statement has caused some shock and disbelief among the general public, with many questioning the need for better facilities and communication regarding these procedures. Families affected by this situation expressed their disappointment and concern over not being informed about the storage of their loved ones' bodies. It is unclear if the lack of communication was due to the overwhelming number of cases or a deliberate decision by hospital bosses. The hospital is currently investigating the incident and apologizing to the families affected by this lack of transparency. While it is acknowledged that the demand during Easter weekend was unprecedented, it is crucial for healthcare facilities to maintain an open line of communication with the relatives of deceased patients and provide clear, compassionate information in the face of such difficult circumstances. The revelation of using refrigerated lorries in hospital mortuaries has led to a nationwide discussion about the state of mortuary facilities and the need for better solutions for times of high demand. Many are calling for improvements to be made to prevent similar situations in the future. In response to this incident and the wider debate over storage facilities and practices, some hospitals are reviewing their methods and considering changes to improve transparency with grieving families. The goal will be to ensure that families are aware of the procedures used in preserving the bodies of deceased loved ones, while the authorities work on improving the capacity of mortuaries during high demand. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the immense pressure that medical facilities and healthcare workers continue to face during trying times. It is imperative that continued efforts be made to improve transparency and communication between hospitals and families in delicate situations like these. As the story unfolds, it is a time for reflection on the importance of compassion and transparency in healthcare and the need for better infrastructure and planning to ensure the dignity and respect of deceased patients are maintained throughout the process.", "OC use induced many changes in hematological and plasmatic markers, modifying hormonal levels, endothelial function, inflammation index and some redox state parameters, producing a perturbation of the internal milieu that impacted macrophagic function. In fact, different levels of estrogen receptor expression and release of TNF were observed in macrophages derived from OC users. Some of the above activities were linked to the androgenic properties of progestin. Even though it is not known whether these effects are reversible, the results indicate that to avoid potential skewing of results only a single type of OC should be used during a single clinical trial.", "Person1: Really? I didn't think he was that bad. Person2: Yeah, I've heard stories about him stepping on others to get ahead. Plus, he lies about small things all the time. Person1: I haven't noticed that about him.

I'll keep that in mind.", "While genome-wide significant DNA methylation differences were not detected for individual CpG-sites, strong evidence for DNA hypermethylation of CD8 T cells for MS patients was observed, indicating a role for DNA methylation in MS. Further, our results suggest that large DNA methylation differences for CpG-sites tested here do not contribute to MS susceptibility. In particular, large DNA methylation differences for CpG-sites within 148 established MS candidate genes tested in our study cannot explain missing heritability. Larger studies of homogenous MS patients and matched controls are warranted to further elucidate the impact of CD8 T cell and more subtle DNA methylation changes in MS development and pathogenesis.", "Person1: Did the children enjoy the holiday camp or were they all homesick? Person2: Well, I must admit some of the younger kids were a little bit unhappy, because they've never been away on their own before and didn't know some of the other kids. But soon they recovered. By the last day, they didn't want to go home because they were having such a great time. Person1: What sort of things did you do with them? Person2: Well, there were some trips, including a visit to the Holyrood, the Castle. That was what we did on the first day. I think they were expecting it to be rather boring, especially when they heard they were having a guided tour. But they were wrong. The guide was very interesting. He told them some interesting stories of Edinburgh and really made the history of the Edinburgh castle come alive. Person1: I can imagine. What sort of sports activities did they do? Person2: Ceiling, climbing, horse-riding and the like. And on the last day, we had a barbeque, which was their favorite. The kids enjoyed it very much. They all promised to come and get together again next year.", "Some studies have found that functional changes in back muscle activity can be associated with pain intensity and prediction of low back pain during pregnancy. Pregnant women often experience low back pain due to changes in their body, such as weight gain and alterations in posture, which can lead to an increased load on their spine. This, in turn, can affect back muscle activity. One study found that pregnant women suffering from low back pain had altered patterns of muscle activity in their back and abdominal muscles compared to those who did not experience pain. Additionally, the level of muscle activity was found to correlate with the intensity of their pain. Furthermore, pregnant women who had higher levels of back muscle activity were more likely to develop low back pain over time. However, it is important to note that the relationship between back muscle activity and low back pain during pregnancy is complex and not completely understood. Other factors, such as hormonal changes, psychological factors, and previous history of low back pain, may also play a role in the development and intensity of low back pain during pregnancy. Further research is needed to better understand these complex relationships and develop appropriate interventions to help prevent and alleviate low back pain for pregnant women.", "No significant improvement in film readers' sensitivity or specificity or gain in cost-effectiveness was established in either study. This may be due to the system's low specificity, its relatively poor sensitivity for subtle cancers or the fact the prompts cannot serve as aids to decision-making. Readers may have been better able to make use of the prompts after becoming more accustomed to working with them. Prompts may have an impact in routine use that is not detectable in an experimental setting. Although the case for CAD as an element of the NHS Breast Screening Programme is not made here, further research is required. Evaluations of new CAD tools in routine use are underway and their results should be given careful attention.", "We have clearly demonstrated that, contrary to the generally accepted paradigm, expression of NF-M and MAP (RA4) proteins is not exclusive to ganglion cells. Rather, both proteins are transiently expressed by all neuronal retinal progenitors in a developmentally-regulated manner. In addition, MAP (RA4) and NF-M are the first molecules so far characterized that may allow unambiguous identification of postmitotic precursors from the pool of mitotically active progenitors andor the differentiated cell population during retinogenesis. These results are of significant impact for the field of developmental biology of the retina, since they provide novel and important information for the appropriate design and interpretation of studies on retinal cell differentiation, as well as for the reinterpretation of previously published studies.", "Person1: I hope it stays like this for the weekend.

It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up or occasionally down the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. \"It could have been a super low today,\" a disappointed Woods said after his round. \"All in all. It should have been two shots better.\" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible . The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. \"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.", "The present study showed the limitations of hypersensitive response mediated resistance, especially when foreign encounters involved the food production as well as the translocation machinery of the host. It was also predicted from the obtained results that hypersensitivity and active species generation failed to impart host defense in compatible interaction between chickpea and Fusarium. On the contrary, the defense related gene (s) played a critical role in conferring natural resistance to the resistant host. Thus, this study suggests that natural selection is the decisive factor for selecting and segregating out the suitable type of defense mechanism to be undertaken by the host without disturbing its normal metabolism, which could deviate from the known classical defense mechanisms.", "Person1: Hi! What are you watching? Person2: It's a program about islam. It's very interesting. Person1: Wow! So many people! Where are they and what are they doing? Person2: They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca. Muslims call this pilgrimage 'haj'. Person1: Why do they go there? Person2: Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life. Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith. Person1: When muslims pray, they face towards mecca. Person2: That's right. Unfortunately, so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed. Person1: I heard about that. The pilgrims must walk around a large, sacred black stone. Person2: That's right. That's when accidents often happen. The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims, to reduce the chances of accidents. Person1: Pilgrimages are common in many faiths. Person2: Yes. In England, Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages. Person1: Isn't there a place in france where people go to get healed? Person2: I think that place is Lourdes. There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there. Person1: Do you think that there is something magical about that place? Person2: Personally. I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them.

Doerr's captivating novel \"All the Light We Cannot See\" claimed the Pulitzer for fiction while Kolbert's thought-provoking work \"The Sixth Extinction\" emerged as the winner in the general nonfiction category. \"All the Light We Cannot See,\" published in 2014, is a historical novel that weaves together the intriguing and heart-wrenching stories of a blind French girl and a young German soldier during the Second World War. The novel cleverly intertwines their paths, exploring the complex themes of morality, survival, and war's brutal impact on innocent lives. Doerr's unique narrative style and masterful storytelling ability have earned him a special place among the literary world's finest, with the Pulitzer catapulting his work into further prominence. As one of the most sought-after distinctions in the field of literature, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction stands as a testament to Doerr's extraordinary skills as a writer. The award carries not only a prestigious reputation but also a cash prize of 15,000, which is bound to enhance the author's literary stature. In the general nonfiction category, Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" (2014) emerged as the standout winner. Kolbert's work delves into the disturbing prospect of the Earth's sixth mass extinction, asserting that human behavior is playing a significant role in the ongoing destruction of countless species. Meticulously researched and extensively documented, the book is a powerful and haunting portrayal of the irreversible consequences of humanity's actions on the planet. The Pulitzer Prize serves as a remarkable validation of Kolbert's efforts to raise awareness about the impending ecological catastrophe. With a cash prize of 15,000 accompanying this honor, she, too, is poised to receive the widespread acknowledgment that her work so rightfully deserves. The Pulitzer Prizes, established in 1917, are awarded annually in 21 categories encompassing journalism, literature, drama, and music. These distinctions strive to encourage creativity, promote critical thought, and spur on innovation, all while celebrating excellence within these fields. The accolades received by Doerr and Kolbert exemplify the unyielding power of the written word in shaping our understanding of humanity's precarious place in history and the world at large.", "I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and I don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto DVD, but this looked so interesting and scary! I must say, I was quite impressed with this hidden gem. The storyline was engaging, the characters were well-developed, and the suspense had me on the edge of my seat. The plot revolves around a troubled priest, Father James, who is called upon to perform an exorcism on a young girl, Isabel, in the remote town of Blackwater Valley. What sets this film apart from other exorcism-themed movies is the unique twist - the demon possessing Isabel seems to have a connection to the town's dark history. The acting in this film is top-notch, with a standout performance from Cameron Daddo as Father James. The special effects were impressive, considering it's a direct-to-DVD release, and the chilling atmosphere effectively sets the stage for some truly terrifying moments. The film is not without its flaws - there are some pacing issues, and a few plot points were left unresolved. However, these minor issues didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie. In conclusion, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is an underrated horror flick that delivers genuine suspense and terror. If you're a fan of the genre, don't let the DVD release status deter you from giving this a watch. You may just find yourself pleasantly surprised.", "The Arctic Warbler separated into three main clades in close succession around the PliocenePleistocene border, with the two northern clades diverging last. All three clades probably experienced population bottlenecks during the Pleistocene as a result of range shifts and contractions, but nevertheless survived and maintained their integrities. Several other clades of Northeastern Palearctic birds are noted to have diversified during the Pliocene. In contrast, avian species or phylogroups presently occupying formerly glaciated North American ground are generally younger. The differences between these regions could be due to slower speciation rates in the Eastern Palearctic due to less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer survival of Eastern Palearctic clades as a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern North America. Several other Palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns to that of the Arctic Warbler, indicating common causes of their diversifications.", "IC50 for S247 adhesion to alpha (v) beta3 or alpha (IIB) beta3a substrates was 0.2 nM vs. 244 nM, respectively. Likewise, S247 was not toxic at doses up to 1000 microM. However, osteoclast cultures treated with S247 exhibited marked morphological changes and impaired formation of the actin sealing zone. When S247 was administered prior to tumor cells, there was a significant, dose-dependent reduction (25-50 of vehicle-only-treated mice; P 0.002) in osseous metastasis. Mice receiving S247 after tumor cell inoculation also developed fewer bone metastases, but the difference was not statistically significant. These data suggest that, in the MDA-MB-435 model, the alpha (v) beta3 integrin plays an important role in early events (e.g., arrest of tumor cells) in bone metastasis. Furthermore, the data suggest that alpha (v) beta3 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment andor prevention of breast cancer metastases in bone.", "World No 1 Novak Djokovic became the first player to win the opening three ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events when he defeated Tomas Berdych 7-5 4-6 6-3 at Monte Carlo on Sunday. Djokovic had overpowered eight-time champion Rafael Nadal to reach the final, not dropping a set on his 2015 clay-court debut this week. However, the 27-year-old Serb did not have it all his own way in a rain-hit match against Berdych, who had forced a break in the very first game and later rallied to force a deciding set.

Djokovic, though, eventually came through to extend his winning streak to 17 matches and the advantage over Roger Federer in the world rankings to more than 5,000 points. Berdych had signalled his intent with an early break, only for Djokovic to regain his composure and lead 5-3 before eventually closing out the first set after 53 minutes. The Serbian became the first player to win the opening three Masters 1000 events . Berdych battled to win the second set but could not prevent defeat by Djokovic . Djokovic was on court for almost three hours as he overcame the Czech in three sets . Djokovic was 3-2 up in the second before rain took the players off court for the best part of an hour. Berdych, the world No 8 who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January, came back refreshed and broke at 4-3 before levelling the match with some powerful forehands. However, a string of unforced errors from the Czech in the decider then allowed Djokovic to move into a 4-0 lead, from which he closed out victory in two hours and 43 minutes.", "There is evidence to suggest that differential production of apoptosis-modulating proteins may occur in patients with hypertrophic burn scars. Hypertrophic scars are characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, primarily collagen, due to abnormal wound healing following burn injuries. This abnormal wound healing process can be linked to the dysregulation of apoptosis, which is programmed cell death that helps to maintain tissue homeostasis. Various studies have shown that expressions of apoptosis-related proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF, are altered in hypertrophic scar tissues as compared to normal skin tissues. Some of these proteins, like Bcl-2, are anti-apoptotic, while others, like Bax and caspase-3, promote apoptosis. For example, one study found that hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (cells responsible for collagen production) expressed higher levels of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, and lower levels of Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, compared to normal skin fibroblasts. This dysregulation of apoptosis may contribute to the accumulation of cells and extracellular matrix components in hypertrophic scar tissue. Additionally, TGF-, a key player in wound healing and fibrosis, has also been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. TGF- levels have been found to be increased in hypertrophic scar tissue, promoting fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. Although research is still ongoing, these findings suggest that differential production of apoptosis-modulating proteins is a potential contributing factor to the development of hypertrophic burn scars. Future studies may help to identify more specific targets for therapeutic interventions to prevent or minimize the formation of hypertrophic scars following burn injuries.", "Person1: That's great to hear. Can you share an example of a successful project you completed with your team? Person2: Of course. In my previous job, we had a major project where we needed to develop a marketing campaign for a new product launch. I collaborated with my team members to conduct market research, create promotional materials, and organize events. Our efforts led to a successful product launch, with a significant increase in sales and overall brand visibility. Person1: That sounds like an impressive accomplishment. How do you handle challenges when working with a team? Person2: When facing challenges, I believe that communication is crucial. I try to listen actively to my team members' concerns and ideas and encourage open discussions to address any issues.

The former Liverpool and Scotland forward asserted that Kane has already moved beyond that level and should focus on representing the senior team. Kane, 21, made his England debut in an Euro 2016 qualifying victory against Lithuania and marked the occasion with a goal just 80 seconds after coming on as a substitute. He also featured in England's friendly match against Italy and has established himself as one of the country's most promising young talents, scoring eight goals in 10 appearances for the Under-21 team. Despite his impressive run, Dalglish believes that Kane should now focus on progressing with Gareth Southgate's senior team rather than taking a step back to represent the Under-21s. Dalglish, who is widely regarded as one of football's greatest players, said: \"Having watched Harry Kane's performances last week, there is no way he should return to the Under-21s. He has moved on now, and when the Under-21 championships come around in the summer, I don't think there's any point in taking him.\" Kane has enjoyed a breakthrough season at Tottenham, notching up 29 goals in all competitions and becoming the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 20 league goals in a season. His remarkable form has drawn comparisons with some of the game's leading strikers, prompting calls for Kane to be included in Southgate's plans for the summer tournament. However, as Dalglish suggests, it may be better for his development and England's future to focus on the senior team.", "Everyone is entitled to an opinion, yet sometimes it is difficult to grasp how others can develop such strong, positive views on a film that was, in your view, an unmitigated disaster. Such was the case with the latest release, \"The Doomed Voyage.\" Many have raved about the film's stunning visual effects and the emotionally charged performances of the lead actors. However, the movie's brilliance was profoundly marred by a convoluted and weak plot that left the audience with little more than a migraine. While it is undeniable that the impeccable cinematography creates several breathtaking moments throughout, you can't help but feel utterly disappointed when these scenes are followed by gaping plot holes and contrived twists. The wasted potential of this movie is honestly the most disheartening part, with what could have been a gripping, character-driven story turning into a hollow attempt at being Oscar bait. The lead actors are undeniably talented, and they do their best with the material. But even their efforts are not enough to save \"The Doomed Voyage\" from sinking into the abyss of mediocrity. Their intense emotions and heartfelt portrayals would have been a marvel to witness if attached to a more cohesive and engaging script. Instead, their hard work drowns in the meandering narrative. In conclusion, although everyone is entitled to an opinion, it's hard to fathom how anyone can excuse the glaring flaws in \"The Doomed Voyage.\" Stunning visuals and dedicated actors are not enough to keep this ship afloat, and instead, it serves as a prime example that even such natural beauty cannot polish a fundamentally broken film.", "Our results demonstrate that in p53-deficient human gastric cancer cells, restoration of functional miR-34 inhibits cell growth and induces chemosensitization and apoptosis, indicating that miR-34 may restore p53 function.

You would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen.", "Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully made film that takes small, carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. Anchored by a captivating performance by Toni Servillo, the film tells the story of Titta Di Girolamo, a mysterious and intriguing man with a dark past, living in isolation in a hotel. Director Paolo Sorrentino masterfully creates a visually stunning and atmospheric world that envelops viewers in Titta's lonely and mysterious existence. The film's deliberate pacing, like a slow dance, allows us to truly immerse ourselves in its mood and feel the weight of the protagonist's story. The screenplay unfolds with a subtle complexity, peeling back the layers of the characters as we discover the consequences of their choices, ultimately forcing them to confront their own demons. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty, melancholy, and grit of the settings in a poetic manner. Furthermore, the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack by Pasquale Catalano complements the film's dark and moody atmosphere, perfectly underscoring the emotional weight of the story. The supporting cast delivers strong performances, bringing depth to their characters and enriching the experience. Le conseguenze dell'amore is not just a film, but rather an experience that slowly unravels, rewarding patient viewers with a deeply emotional and satisfying conclusion. It is an absorbing, thought-provoking masterpiece that showcases Sorrentino's remarkable talent as a filmmaker and serves as a brilliant example of Italian cinema. Highly recommended for those who appreciate a slower pace and rich visual storytelling.", "Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla has said he is happy to stay at Arsenal despite interest from Atletico Madrid, although he admits that 'you never know what the future will bring'.

As the renovations are ongoing, some fans were left with no choice but to relieve themselves into plastic cups as they fought the massive lines for the limited restrooms available at the iconic stadium. The situation was further aggravated when there were reports of two bathrooms flooding, forcing thousands to queue for over an hour. Social media quickly filled with images of the long lines, posted by angry fans who had paid significant sums for tickets only to spend much of their experience waiting for a bathroom. Wrigley Field, known for its old-school charm, is receiving its first massive renovation in its 80-year history to modernize the stadium. However, the poor management of the restroom situation has left many fans questioning the priorities of the notoriously iconic ballpark. Officials from the Chicago Cubs have not yet addressed these complaints, but if the poor conditions persist and fans continue to be left with no alternative than public urination in plastic cups, the team may face a series of possible repercussions and negative sentiment towards the historic stadium. Prioritizing improvements and addressing these issues will be key for Wrigley Field's management to maintain good relations with their die-hard fans and ensure that the stadium remains a beloved landmark for generations to come.", "If anyone at National Lampoon is reading this PLEASE STOP THE CRAP YOUR PULLING OUT OF YOUR BUM, really now!

Secondly, there was the suggestion in the data that impairments of starvation, cold and desiccation resistance were worse for the strain lacking glgB, though the first of these was not statistically significant. The results provide prima facie evidence linking abiotic stress tolerance with shorter glycogen ACL. However, further work needs to be done, perhaps in a less labile species.

In contrast, p21p27 double knockout mice developed osteopetrosis, with fewer osteoclasts that exhibited lower TRACP activity and abnormal cell morphology present in long bone. Moreover, isolated osteoclast progenitors from p21p27 double knockout mice were defective in RANKL-mediated differentiation in vitro, expressing low levels of osteoclast-specific genes like TRACP and cathepsin K. Taken together, these data suggest p27KIP1 and p21CIP1 play roles in osteoclast differentiation in response to RANKL signaling distinct from their roles in promoting cell cycle withdrawal.", "Forget sober black and charcoal grey.

Christine Lagarde, the first female chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, left, in a pink Chanel suit andPlaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, right, chose hot pink for her live election debate last Thursday . The sudden rise in use among powerful women is said to be down to the way that the colour is perceived - it used to be a girly but is now considered an appropriate shade to wear to a business meeting. In an interview with the newspaper the managing director of image consultants Colour Me Beautiful, Veronique Henderson, said: 'Pink was for a long time viewed as a girlie colour. It was seen as romantic, not serious in business, but that has changed.' Style icon Samantha Cameron is also a big fan of the colour - she chose a pale dusty pink silk top on the campaign trail for the local and European elections last May. Meanwhile, on daytime television both Lorraine Kelly and Ruth Langsford can regularly be seen in pink dresses while presenting their ITV TV shows.

Please follow me, and I'll show you to a nice window-side table.", "The efficacy of this picture was best proven on the intended target audience, namely teens. Set amidst the trials and tribulations of high school, the film masterfully captures the essence of teenage life, deftly blending drama, romance, and lighthearted comedy. Director Johnson skillfully balances these elements by eliciting strong performances from his young cast, who manage to make the audience both laugh and cry throughout the film. At the heart of the movie is a genuine portrayal of the bonds and conflicts between friends, coupled with the timeless struggles and challenges of growing up. By tackling subjects like peer pressure, identity, and family, the film exhibits an honest and unapologetic approach that is sure to resonate with its target demographic. Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes with vibrant colors and stunning cinematography, making the characters' world feel both real and dream-like. The soundtrack features catchy, contemporary tunes that not only complement the narrative but also enhance its emotional depth, transporting the viewer straight into the rollercoaster ride that is adolescence. What stands out most, however, is the relatability of the film's characters. Each one is distinctly flawed yet incredibly endearing, encouraging the audience to reflect upon their own journey through self-discovery. It allows for a sense of nostalgia for adults and a comforting reassurance for teens still navigating the turbulent waters of their teenage years. In conclusion, this film is a crowning achievement in the realm of teenage cinema, serving as both a source of entertainment and a potent commentary on modern-day adolescence. It is a must-see for young and old alike, and a benchmark for what a teen movie should aspire to be.", "ASCENDING to power in 1933, Hitler and his \"National Socialist German Workers Party,\" which of course we all know as the Nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by. Early in their rough-shod trampling of the German People, they called any and all artists, newspaper men and film makers into their Nazi HQ in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared \"Third Reich\" (aka 'Empire expected of them.WHEN the Master Director from the German Cinema's Silent Impressionist and Expressionist era, Mr. Fritz Lang, was called in to meet with Herr Goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the Minister of Propaganda's office, Herr Lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Not even going back to his residence, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least not until many years later. He remained in France; eventually immigrating to the United States of America. MR. LANG went right to work in America; creating a variety of most enjoyable, solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year. Included in this smorgasbord of titles is today's lucky subject, WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941).TYPICALLY a film about the Old West and Pioneer Days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast. WESTERN UNION qualified on both requisites. We are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses.HEADING up the playbill are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore. Others prominently displayed are folks like John Carradine (playing not a vampire or other scary guy, but a Physician), George \"Slim\" Summerville (veteran character actor, Silent Film veteran and graduate of Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always dependable supporting player and former singer in \"The Avalon Boys and burly bad guy Barton MacLane. Added to this mix, we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard's bro).PROMINENT in those American Indians featured are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. Also featured is that one great representative of the Aboriginal Peoples of North America is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, the Louisiana Native, Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents).THE filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in Arizona and Utah and rendered in the highest grade of Technigolour available. (There is no Monument Valley; but then, that's the Province of Mr. John Ford.) IN some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; for it took a sort of pulp magazine story, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war America of the late thirties and early forties. All of this being done by a German born Director who was only had been in Hollywood and America for the shortest length of time.IN its final analysis, WESTERN UNION, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the Western Genre; we just don't care. It scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies! SO, who really cares about little details such as \"accuracy\"? WE give Mr. Lang and 20th Century-Fox a rating of !NOTE: We just saw a special on PBS station WTTW, here in Chicago that was all about all of the Film Actors, Directors and other Artisans whom the Nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in America and Hollywood.

POODLE SCHNITZ!!", "Person1: That sounds like a dream come true for many people. Can you share with us some of the challenges you faced when starting your own business, and how you overcame them? Person2: Certainly, starting a business is no easy task. One of the main challenges I faced was finding the right location for my store. I had to research the local bike market and find an area with enough demand, but not too much competition. Once I found the location, I spent a lot of time renovating and setting up the store, which was both physically and financially exhausting. However, I stayed focused on my goal and enlisted the help of family and friends to make it happen. Another challenge was building a customer base. At first, I relied heavily on word-of-mouth and social media to promote my store. Over time, I've built relationships with local cycling clubs and organizations, which has helped increase my customer base and establish a reputation in the community. Person1: That's great to hear. Being a business owner certainly comes with its own set of rewards and challenges. What advice would you give to someone who is considering starting their own business? Person2: Firstly, I would say that it's important to have a solid business plan and be prepared for the ups and downs that come with owning a business. Do your research and ensure there's a market for your product or service. Be prepared to invest your time, energy, and money into your business, especially during the early stages. Secondly, I can't stress enough the importance of networking and building relationships. Connect with people who can help you grow your business, whether it's suppliers, other business owners, or potential customers. Share your passion and enthusiasm with others and never stop marketing yourself and your business. Lastly, patience is key. Results may not come as quickly as you'd like, but with hard work, determination, and a positive attitude, you can overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. Person1: Wise words indeed. Thank you, Mr. Kayne, for joining us and sharing your journey with us. We wish you continued success in your bicycle shop and hope that your story inspires others to follow their dreams as well. Person2: Thank you for having me. It's been a pleasure to share my story and I hope it encourages others to take the leap and pursue their passions.", "There is some evidence to suggest that high expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and markers of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation may define a more favorable subgroup of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas. However, more research is needed to confirm this relationship and determine its clinical implications. HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the development and progression of various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which includes pulmonary adenocarcinomas. HER2 overexpression andor gene amplification are seen in a subset of NSCLCs, and it has been suggested that these patients may benefit from targeted HER2 therapies. The PI3K signaling pathway is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival, and its activation has been implicated in many human cancers, including lung cancer. Some studies have found that markers of PI3K pathway activation, such as increased phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins, are associated with a better prognosis in specific subgroups of NSCLCs. In a study by Landi et al. (2016), the authors investigated the associations between HER2 expression, PI3K pathway activation markers, and patient outcomes in a cohort of 126 patients with metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas. They found that high HER2 expression and PI3K pathway activation markers were associated with a more favorable prognosis, particularly in younger patients and those with non-smoking-related tumors. However, this study had some limitations, including a small sample size and retrospective design. Additionally, the authors noted that prospective studies are needed to validate their findings and to evaluate the role of HER2-targeted and PI3K-targeted therapies in this patient subgroup. In conclusion, HER2 expression and markers of PI3K pathway activation may define a more favorable subgroup of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas. However, further research is needed to confirm this relationship and to explore the potential therapeutic implications of these findings.", "Differential expression of the bcl-2 protooncogene and the Fas cell surface receptor in the PBMC fraction of patients with burn injuries may suggest a disequilibrium in a complex biochemical signaling mechanism mediating programmed cell death.

This is confirmed by an in vitro examination of wound fibroblasts versus those from surrounding uninjured skin. This immunoperoxidase technique reveals a localized relative decrease in Fas and ICE, two apoptosis-inducing proteins, at the level of the fibroblast in the proliferative scar specimen.", "While the dog was cute, the film was not. It wasn't the premise, or the theme that was a problem. The premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both. The theme is a worthy one. Helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune.Sadly, the adorable dog, the unique premise, and the theme were undercut by poor acting, stilted dialogue, and amateurish filming.Even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through. How many times can that dog run up and down the same hallway? I can't spoil it for you, as I never saw the end. It just was not worth watching all the way to the end.", "OK from the point of view of an American, who I assume do not know much about rugby, this would be an amazing film for them. First of all, it's got heart, good morals, and the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy. \"Scrumming to Victory\" takes the audience on a wonderful journey of redemption and self-discovery, while teaching the basics of rugby to those who may not be familiar with the sport. With powerful performances from the lead actors, especially the chemistry between the tough coach and the troubled young protagonist, the film manages to capture the raw emotions of real-life struggles. The cinematography is equally stunning, showcasing the beauty of rural New Zealand, which serves as a perfect backdrop for the thrilling rugby scenes. The soundtrack adds an additional layer of depth, heightening the emotions at the right moments, and creating a sense of hope and triumph throughout the film. While the plot might be predictable at times, the overall messaging of overcoming one's past and working together as a team resonates strongly, making it an enjoyable and inspiring watch. The film does an excellent job at breaking down rugby for the uninitiated, inviting them to appreciate the sport's passion and camaraderie. In conclusion, \"Scrumming to Victory\" is a heartwarming and inspiring film that will appeal to both sports fans and those looking for a feel-good story. With strong performances, captivating visuals, and a soundtrack that lifts the spirit, this movie is a definite must-watch for anyone seeking a powerful blend of drama and sports action.", "Person1: Oh no, that's terrible!

He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. After he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete lack of training, but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the AA meetings are interesting. The viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition as Frank's sponsor, although he is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us he is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). The movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to Frank flounders, as the two actors have no chemistry together. Around the time she comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. His characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in his behavior. The comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast.Problems abound in this one. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian, and Hispanic. Throughout the course of the movie, Frank tells numerous people he is a hit man (including an entire AA group), but nobody seems to care, or wants to do anything about it. The movie relies on cliche scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when Leoni's insufferable character chases Frank down at the airport, just when he is about to board a flight back to Buffalo.Though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates one year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen \"You Kill Me.\" My Grade: D", "Edinburgh's Dougie Fife, Alasdair Dickinson, and Ross Ford returned to the squad after being rested following Scotland's Six Nations campaign. The trio will be part of the team facing London Irish in the European Challenge Cup quarter-final. Fife, who deputised at full-back for Scotland's Six Nations campaign, makes his first start since the end of January at his club. Meanwhile, Ford will replace David Cherry at hooker, and Dickinson will swap places with Murray McCallum, returning to the team on a full-time basis. Edinburgh's Head Coach, Richard Cockerill, expressed his delight at having the experienced trio back, stating that their international experience would boost the team's confidence ahead of the crucial quarter-final match against London Irish. \"These are players who have shown what they can do at the highest level, so having them back in our squad can only be a positive thing,\" he said. Moreover, Cockerill also praised Fife's performance during the Six Nations, saying, \"Dougie has been outstanding for Scotland, and we're delighted to have him back. His ability to play at full-back as well gives us added options in the backline.\" However, the coach acknowledged that London Irish would be a tough challenge, despite their recent domestic struggles. \"They may not be having the best time in the Premiership, but they've shown in Europe that they are more than capable of getting results,\" he said. \"We need to be at our best to make sure we progress to the semi-finals.\" This quarter-final clash promises to be an exciting encounter between two sides eager to progress to the next stage of the competition.

Rigid collars generally provide more significant motion restriction than soft collars. Soft collars are usually used for less severe injuries or for a short period, such as during the initial phase of injury recovery. They may provide some support, comfort, and pain relief, but they do not offer the same extent of motion restriction that rigid collars do. Rigid collars, on the other hand, are designed to provide more robust immobilization of the cervical spine. They are commonly used for more severe injuries or post-surgery recovery, where greater restriction in motion is necessary to allow proper healing. During the fifteen activities of daily living, soft and rigid collars will provide some limitation in cervical range of motion, but rigid collars will generally offer a greater degree of restriction. The specific level of restriction will vary depending on the type and design of each collar, and the specific activities being performed. However, it's important to note that rigid collars may be less comfortable to wear for extended periods and may interfere more with daily activities compared to soft collars. In conclusion, both soft and rigid collars can provide cervical motion restriction during activities of daily living, but rigid collars typically offer a higher degree of immobilization than soft collars. The choice between the two should be based on the severity of the injury, the required level of restriction, and the comfort and compatibility with the patient's needs.", "I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy.

He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. Before the term 'Method' was even coined and before Brando ever screamed 'Stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. His earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'Golden Boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. Garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.Ann Sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as Jack's trampy girl Goldie. I haven't ever thought much of Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well off Garfield. Dickson's' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield seems their natural idol (even more so than Cagney). Claude Rains is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. Strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.Also interesting to note is the director- Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. He maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.A very good film that deserves greater attention 810.", "Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on these events, which I guess was simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with cliched a cliched plot that will cause any knowledgeable Cobb fan to cry vinegar tears. Tommy Lee Jones does quite well as a crotchety Cobb, but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy. Most stories about Cobb are barely believable, but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, portraying the writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent. He sucks the life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own Nagasaki. There is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore (Arliss doesn't count. It's barely a show). Even the played out, inevitable \"role reversal\" of Cobb and Stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that don't sound like a poor book on tape narration voice. For all the awful writing and bland film-making on display, there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible. A hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying Cobb's overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance. The camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster Cobb. Every slide, hit, and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound, and Tommy Lee Jones OWNS the intensity of the master player. It makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of Cobb in his prime with the same actor. It's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could have been. I may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of Ty Cobb and wanting it to be something it isn't, but to make such boring, neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical. I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has slid ever since.", "Person1: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see if I can help you. Do you remember where you might have lost it?

Person1: No problem, let's see if we can find it and get you on your way!", "There is limited research on the comparison of feline nasal cavity dimensions measured by acoustic rhinometry and nasal casts. However, for other mammal species, several studies have shown that acoustic rhinometry is an effective method for assessing nasal cavity dimensions. Acoustic rhinometry is a non-invasive technique that uses sound waves to measure the cross-sectional area and volume of the nasal cavity. It has been widely used in humans and animals, including dogs, for evaluating nasal passage dimensions and diagnosing nasal pathologies. Nasal casts, on the other hand, involve creating physical models of the nasal cavity by filling the nasal passages with a liquid material that later solidifies. The casts can then be analyzed using various methods, such as computed tomography (CT), to assess nasal cavity dimensions and structures. In general, both methods have their advantages and limitations. Acoustic rhinometry is non-invasive and allows for a quick assessment of the nasal cavity but may not provide as detailed information on complex structures as other imaging techniques, such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nasal casts can provide more detailed structural information but may be more invasive, particularly if solidification of the cast material proves difficult to remove. Further research is needed to compare these methods specifically in felines and determine how accurately each method reflects the dimensions and structures of the feline nasal cavity.", "Corporal Christian Walmsley was found dead in his flat in Bolton after struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder following tours of duty abroad . A soldier who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after a series of tours abroad wrote suicide notes before taking a fatal overdose, an inquest has heard. Corporal Christian Walmsley was found dead in his flat in Bolton, Greater Manchester wearing five war medals after struggling to adapt to civilian life, a coroner was told. The father-of-three had served in the First Gulf War, Bosnia, Angola and Northern Ireland in the Royal Engineers from 1989 until 2000. The 42-year-old had witnessed the 'significant violence only soldiers experience', the hearing at Bolton Coroners Court was told. After retiring from the army, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and Fibromyalgia, a chronic condition causing deep muscle pain. His family members told the court that Cpl Walmsley's two marriages had ended divorce. He had spent some time in Germany over the last decade before returning to the UK to rebuild relationships with his family, relatives said. Stepfather Michael Richards told the hearing: 'He'd always been such a fit lad. But when he came back he had to use a stick because he was so fatigued.' Mr Richards said his stepson had questioned the support given to former servicemen and women. The inquest heard he had previously taken an overdose and told his family he had tried to take his own life. But he discharged himself from the hospital before he had a mental health assessment. In the weeks leading up to his death, his family said Cpl Walmsley had seemed optimistic. Yet on November 4 last year, he had appeared distressed to friends and sent text messages to his mother telling her he was in pain. He was discovered dead on November 6. Police officers found a notebook with several suicide notes inside, the hearing was told. Cpl Walmsley was among British troops in the First Gulf War (pictured in file photo), as well touring Bosnia . The coroner ruled that, without dates on the notes, he could not be certain Cpl Walmsley had attempted suicide. Recording misadventure as a verdict, Coroner Alan Walsh said: 'During his service he would have experienced things only soldiers go through. 'I hope his children are reminded of the bravery he showed in serving his country.' On PTSD among soldiers, the coroner added: 'I do believe it is important that we acknowledge the stress the disorder causes and the total change it causes to someone's life. Those who do serve in the armed forces witness experiences beyond their imagination.'

While some critics might argue that the relentless vulgarity and vitriol found in this latest offering is a detriment to its overall artistic merit, others will find it a ferocious reminder that not all art is meant to be pretty or polite. The film itself, a darkly comedic exploration of the seedy underbelly of an urban hellscape, is a tour de force for Rogan, who writes, directs, and stars in it. His raw, unfiltered performance showcases his impressive range and depth as an actor, making the audience sympathize with his complicated, morally ambiguous protagonist in a way that proves both uncomfortable and enthralling. The supporting cast is equally impressive, their individual performances grounding the film and providing a certain level of humanity amidst the chaos. In particular, Rogan's on-screen interactions with his co-stars are electric and offer some of the most memorable moments in the movie. Visually, the film's gritty cinematography only adds to the darkly compelling atmosphere, pulling viewers deeper into its twisted narrative. The use of minimalistic music and sound design truly adds to the isolated, decadent world Rogan has masterfully created. While Joe Rogan's latest film may be an acquired taste, for those willing to embrace the darkness and vulgarity, it is an unforgettable experience. The raw, unfiltered emotion and unparalleled storytelling will leave audiences questioning the boundaries of morality and the limits of art.", "Person1: Nowadays, ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be.

Directed by Jan Sverak, the film strikingly portrays the dynamic relationship between an elderly man and a young boy, exploring themes of love, friendship, and humanity. The story revolves around the character of Frantisek, played impeccably by the ever-talented Zdenek Sverak, who unexpectedly becomes the caretaker of a young Russian boy named Kolja. What begins as a reluctant alliance turns into a profound and genuine bond as the two characters navigate their shared experiences and the challenges of a changing world. The cinematography is truly commendable, as the beautiful city of Prague serves as a picturesque background to the story. The diverse and fitting soundtrack perfectly complements the film's emotional tone and heightens the viewer's investment in the characters' experiences. With a perfect balance of humor and heart, \"Kolja\" captivates and moves audiences unlike any other Czech film I have seen. The performances by the entire cast are superb, allowing for a natural and authentic exploration of the human spirit. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece that will undoubtedly leave its mark on the hearts of those who watch it. In summary, \"Kolja\" is a must-see Czech movie that showcases the exceptional talent of its filmmakers and presents a sincere and touching portrait of the human experience. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a film that will make them laugh, cry, and think deeply about the power of love and connections.", "Property portfolio: Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona . The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck - but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property - leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour's mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over 2million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a 20million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for 6.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for 4.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents' in the hope of securing it for his family - his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: 'There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.' Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's 6.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a 'cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well'. He told The Times: 'With a mansion tax, you're taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I'd leave. I'd have to say, \"Sorry, I want to ship out. Campbell has also said: 'I'm not earning what I was earning five years ago.' Experts have said that properties worth between 5million and 10million could incur an annual charge of up to 25,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: 'Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.'

The \"disease concept\" of alcoholism is not needed to justify medical intervention or a caring approach to those who are dependent on alcohol. There is a specific and a general version of the disease concept of alcoholism. The specific disease concept, associated mainly with the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, is contradicted by empirical evidence and unhelpful for preventive and treatment responses to problem drinking, especially for the effort to detect and modify problem drinking at an early stage. The more general disease concept shares these disadvantages and is also ineffective in engendering sympathetic attitudes towards problem drinkers among the general public. It is more useful to view problem drinking as the result of the interaction between the individual's personality and the social context in which he or she has learned how to drink.", "A father-of-two who chopped off his hand with an electric angle cutter is back at work just weeks after surgeons reattached it. Gary Lincoln, 48, from Port Talbot in Wales, was working in a house in Cardiff when his jacket sleeve got caught in the blade and his hand was severed at the wrist, leaving it held on by only flesh and skin. He put in in his sleeve 'to hold everything together' and was taken to hospital where surgeons operated on him for more than seven hours earlier this month. Back at work:Gary Lincoln is carrying out light duties at his workshop just weeks after he severed his hand . Mr Lincoln, who runs a furniture upcycling company a interior design firm, said: 'I didn't feel any pain at all. 'It was like hundreds and thousands of tiny electric shocks that didn't hurt, like very intense pins and needles. 'There was a lot of blood. I got my hand free and put it in my sleeve to hold everything together.' The accident happened when he was on his own using an angle cutter, which was fitted with a safety guard. Neighbours called for an ambulance to take him to the Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Swansea's Morriston Hospital. 'When it happened my main worry was stopping the bleeding but I was also thinking \"That's it. I've just ruined my life, Gary said. 'I'm right-handed but need both hands to do my work.

Some studies also suggest that it may mediate immunoregulatory effects. A study published in Blood (2013) investigated whether Palifermin could mediate immunoregulatory effects in a murine model of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The results of this study showed that Palifermin has potential immunomodulatory effects, including the ability to enhance regulatory T cell (Treg) reconstitution and function, limit pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cell expansion, and impede dendritic cell (DC) activation and maturation. This suggests that Palifermin may contribute to both cytoprotection and immunoregulation in the context of acute GvHD, making it a promising therapeutic agent in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients at high risk for acute GvHD. However, additional studies and clinical trials are needed to further understand these immunoregulatory effects and assess the overall safety and efficacy of Palifermin for this application.", "Neovessels generated from corneal limber arteries in tumor tissues were observed 4-14 days after the implantation of tumor cells. The density of CD31-immunopositive cells in endothelium increased after the implantation of DU145 or HT1080 cells, while that of -SMA-immunopositive cells slightly increased. The NGF treatment significantly increased the density of -SMA- but not that of CD31-immunopositive cells (except for DU145 cells) and resulted in the innervation of perivascular nerves around tumor-derived neovessels, whereas no innervation was observed in the control group. Key Messages: These results suggest that NGF facilitates the innervation of perivascular nerves to regulate blood flow into tumor-derived neovessels.", "The data presented here suggests that cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of APP may affect its normal cellular function. For example, association of P-APP with the centrosome may affect spindle assembly and cell cycle progression, further contributing to the development of pathology in AD. The experiments with G1S inhibitors suggest that cell cycle inhibition may impede the development of Alzheimer's pathology by suppressing modification of APP, and thus may represent a novel approach to AD treatment. Finally, the cell cycle regulated phosphorylation and processing of APP into A and the C-terminal fragment suggest that these proteins may have a normal function during mitosis.", "Person1: Sons is a store located on 5th Avenue, about 10 blocks away from PHS.", "This is a wonderful movie...it's funny, dark, poignant, thought-provoking, innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around. I don't know that I've seen the like before...\"The Rapture,\"or maybe one of Todd Solondz's black-as-night \"comedies\" or even the recent movie \"Teeth\" come to mind...but those are all bitter, nasty little gems. \"Franklins,\" despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart.The story is similar to John Waters' \"Low Down Dirty Shame,\" only this film differs in that it actually HAS a story, and something to say as well, beyond Waters' juvenile \"Sex isn't dirty (snicker, nudge-nudge) \" message. A conservative, repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly aren't so conservative anymore...in fact, they're finally actually happy, probably the only people in their town (or maybe the entire world) who are. To talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film; simply put, everyone should see it, though of course only people who are already sold on what the movie's upbeat, hopeful philosophy is ever would.The acting is greatjust this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavy...Teresa Willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when she's freed up. Both she and Robertson Dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances (not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes); they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a \"deviant sex practice\" into a touching, believable and endearing moment. Aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch, perfectly capturing the attitude, angst and speech patterns of a girl her age. Vince Pavia as the \"himbo\" brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting. Mari Blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother Franklin is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over-the-top.Technically the film looks fantastic, all bright colors and wide-open locales...it looks like it may have been shot Hi-def...if so, the line has gotten very thin, it looks very much like film. There is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical, which gets a bit preachy (moreso, I'd imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the film's politics), but this film says a lot of things that need saying...if only people wouldn't be afraid to listen and think. The arguments that take place are smart and well thought out, first and foremost refusing to demonize either the religious OR non-religious parties.The ending is on the ambiguous side, which I found a bit of a disappointment somehow...I think it would've worked better had the author (as Jay Floyd is, since he produced, wrote and directed) given a more workable denouement, some sort of solution, but then again, there probably isn't one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another. All the same, it was a moving, memorable final image that left me choked upa success.

Ascarosides are small signaling molecules that play significant roles in various biological processes within the nematode, such as dauer formation, social behavior, and mate attraction. Diet is an essential factor that influences the production of ascarosides, as the availability of food can alter their expression levels. Studies have shown that the production of these signaling molecules is heavily affected by the type and amount of bacteria that C. elegans consume. Likewise, the developmental stage of C. elegans also plays a crucial role in determining ascaroside expression levels. The presence and absence of certain ascarosides during specific developmental stages provide an indication that their production is tightly regulated throughout the nematode's life cycle. Variation in ascaroside profiles is also observed across different stages, with some ascarosides being more abundant at particular developmental time points. Both diet and developmental stage are important factors that govern ascaroside expression levels in C. elegans, highlighting the complexity and adaptability of these signaling molecules in the organism.", "The United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has chosen to retire the names of ancient Egyptian goddess Isis and requested the name Odile, instead opting for Ivette and Odile's replacement, Odalys for its list of hurricane names for 2016.

In a poll of 15,560 general practitioners (GPs), one in ten is said to be contemplating moving to countries for higher remuneration, with larger percentages of doctors also considering part-time work or leaving the medical profession entirely. The survey reveals that one in six GPs is considering moving to part-time roles to alleviate the stress of their demanding jobs, while 7 are deliberating quitting medicine for good. The medical profession, especially GPs, has been under immense pressure in recent years due to an increasing workload, demanding patients, and significant administrative burdens. The industry has also been hit with a recruitment and retention crisis, resulting in longer waiting times for patients seeking medical attention. This survey arrives at an interesting time, as family doctors in the UK have greatly benefited from a pay deal in the early 2000s, which saw their salaries increase by 50. However, this considerable wage increase has not significantly impacted the intentions of doctors to move abroad or seek alternative careers. In a statement addressing the revelations of this survey, a spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care has assured the public that they are increasing investment in general practice and have committed to hiring around 6,000 more primary care doctors by 2024. However, with such a large number of doctors considering leaving the profession altogether or moving to part-time work to cope with the increasing strain, it remains to be seen whether this investment will be enough to ensure the future stability of the UK's healthcare sector. In the meantime, patients may face longer waiting times, and rural communities may be at heightened risk of losing GP services altogether.", "Person1: I'm sorry, but Mark is unavailable at the moment. Can I take a message or help you with something else?", "Landmark Legal Challenge in Queensland Over Speeding Ticket: Prominent Lawyer Invokes Centuries-Old Privilege In a groundbreaking legal challenge, prominent Queensland lawyer Tony Morris QC is contesting a speeding ticket by invoking spousal privilege to protect his wife. Morris's blue Volvo was caught doing 57kmh in a 50kmh zone last year, but the lawyer maintains he was not driving the car and refuses to give the name of the person who was behind the wheel, which would likely incriminate his wife. The spousal privilege case cited by Morris dates back to 1817, stating that a husband cannot be compelled to incriminate their spouse. This intriguing turn of events has led to a landmark legal challenge in Queensland, as traffic infringements are considered strict liability offences and the owner of the vehicle is responsible for paying fines unless they can identify the driver. Tony Morris, who is well-known for his successful legal practice, asserts that he should not be held responsible for the infringement as he was not the driver at the time and will not reveal the person who was. Instead, he has cited a centuries-old common law privilege that has rarely been used in modern times to defend his position. The spousal privilege case from 1817 is based on two primary principles: the husband's duty of confidentiality towards his wife and the principle against self-incrimination. In short, the privilege means that a husband cannot be compelled to disclose information that would incriminate his wife against her wishes. Legal experts are divided on the potential outcome of this landmark case, with some suggesting that the Queensland courts will reject Morris's argument and uphold the speeding ticket. Others argue that should the courts accept the spousal privilege as a valid defence, it could set a precedent that opens the door for countless other traffic offences to be contested on the same grounds. The case has garnered significant attention and debate in the legal and wider community, with many curious to see how the courts will handle this complex issue. A decision is expected in the coming weeks, and the ramifications of the verdict could potentially impact the way traffic offences are handled across Australia. With the spotlight firmly on this landmark legal challenge, it remains to be seen whether Tony Morris QC will be successful in his quest to avoid paying the speeding ticket and, in doing so, create a momentous shift in Queensland law.", "Person1: That's interesting!

Similar gene classes are also methylated in aphids and honeybees, suggesting either conservation or convergence of methylation patterns. In addition to this evidence of evolutionary stability, we also show that infection with the virulent wMelPop Wolbachia strain induces additional methylation and demethylation events in the genome. While most of these changes seem random with respect to gene function and have no detected effect on transcription, there does appear to be enrichment of genes associated with membrane function. Given that Wolbachia lives within a membrane-bound vacuole of host origin and retains a large number of genes for transporting host amino acids, inorganic ions and ATP despite a severely reduced genome, these changes might represent an evolved strategy for manipulating the host environments for its own gain.

Not to say that this is a bad movie, in fact it's a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions - dilemma, sorrow, love.., esp it's the director's debut (read from somewhere, is it true?). I felt that something's not quite right, maybe it's just me, I'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world. This is a simple story, about ordinary people, ordinary lives. Through simple and short dialogs, the director tries to relate a simple guy's life, and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time. Oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me, such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man! I must say, I didn't feel the impact that most readers felt, in fact I was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they're comfortable with each other, the granny who came back for another shot - this is kinda melancholic, the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad - hmm but this is predictable.. Don't misunderstood that I'm an action-lover, independent films are my cup of tea! Perhaps I just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery. Some Asian films worth the watch: Tony Takitani (depicts loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialog) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness as well) 15 (gangsters lives in local setting) Before sunrise and Before sunset (I just have to mention these even though they are not Asian films.

After seeing a specialist on Wednesday, the 30-year-old jockey was advised to retire to avoid further injury. Condon, who recently announced his retirement to Horse Racing Ireland, had a successful career as a jockey, riding over 500 winners during his stints in Ireland and Britain. \"I thought I just had a straightforward dead leg but I went for an MRI scan as a precaution in case my pelvis moved or it was more serious,\" Condon said. \"The specialist told me I had a narrowing of the spinal cord, which is something I might've been born with but it would only come out if I got a bang in a certain way.\" Following the fall, doctors discovered a cracked T6 vertebrae and a narrowing of the spinal cord, which put him at a significantly increased risk of paralysis following any further falls. Condon was given no choice but to announce his immediate retirement on medical grounds. \"Basically, he (the specialist) gave me two options,\"Condon added. \"Risk it and have an operation that would mean having open surgery in my neck and that wouldn't guarantee me I could get back race-riding anyway or retire.\" The decision to retire came as a shock to Condon, but he said he maintains a positive outlook and is eager to explore new opportunities in the racing industry. \"I never thought I'd go on training but now it's something I'm going to look into,\" Condon revealed. \"I'm 30 years old now and I'm going into the big bad world.\" The racing community has offered words of encouragement and support for Condon as he embarks on the next chapter of his life. Fans and fellow jockeys took to social media to express their sympathy and wish him a speedy recovery. Davy Condon's announcement marks the end of an impressive career that saw him ride for top-flight trainers such as Edward O'Grady and Gordon Elliott. While it's never easy when a career comes to a sudden end, especially due to injury, the racing world will no doubt remember Condon's many achievements and the impact he had on the sport.", "Person1: I'd like to open a current account.

Diplomatic cables have divulged information about a Ukrainian air force plane being shot down on July 14, merely three days before the ill-fated Malaysian flight. This raises concerns about whether appropriate measures were taken to prevent the tragedy, which caused the loss of 298 lives. The newly surfaced diplomatic cables refer to an incident where a Ukrainian AN-26 transport plane was shot down, allegedly by Russian-backed rebels, just days before MH17 took a similar route. These cables, reportedly classified as confidential until 2034, have triggered a political debate in Germany. Many are questioning if the German government did enough to warn airlines about the dangers of flying above the eastern part of Ukraine, amid an ongoing territorial conflict. Olaf Scholz, Mayor of Hamburg and Deputy Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), has called for a thorough investigation into the matter. He indicated that the government's awareness of the risks should have been passed on to the involved airlines if it was not done already. Scholz further explained that every German ministry must now thoroughly review its archives, as this new information demands a detailed explanation. While Germany did impose restrictions on its aviation sector after the MH17 crash, the German authorities assert that the responsibility for airspace safety lies with each individual country. According to German media, a transport ministry spokesman claimed, \"The federal government does not have the means for a full risk analysis for all airspaces in comparison to the national authorities.\" The spokesman went on to add that upon receiving information about the Ukrainian air force plane being shot down, another risk assessment was not deemed necessary. Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, also tried to defend the government's actions by stating that despite having knowledge about the July 14 incident, a subsequent commercial flight being attacked seemed highly unlikely. The investigation into the MH17 tragedy is still ongoing. At present, it remains unclear whether the German government failed to provide a warning in a timely manner or whether it simply refrained from sharing vital information. Nevertheless, these new findings suggest that there was a lost opportunity to prevent the disaster. Meanwhile, the victim's relatives continue to suffer and are in need of answers. Thomas Schansman, the father of an 18-year-old Dutch-American killed in the MH17 flight, recently sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding him responsible for his son's untimely death. He further urged the Russian leader to use his position of power to spread peace and prevent such incidents in the future.", "Spoiler AheadI suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for TV movie, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but badly done, the acting wasn't especially good.

The results of repeat biopsies were favourable (no or low-risk PCa) in 594 patients (78.5) and led to reclassification of risk in 163 (21.5). Analysis showed that reclassification to higher risk was significantly influenced by the number of initial positive cores (two vs one) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8; p0.002) and higher PSA density (OR: 2.1; p0.003). The outcome was not significantly influenced by age, clinical stage, total number of biopsy cores, or PSA.

Data on tumour involvement per biopsy core were not available.", "Increased leptin expression in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) has been shown to suppress adiposity without significantly affecting energy intake and metabolic hormones. The DVC plays a central role in regulating energy balance, and leptin is a crucial hormone involved in regulating fat storage and metabolism. Experiments conducted on rodents have given insights into the effects of increased leptin expression in the DVC. In these studies, researchers have observed reductions in body weight and adiposity (fat mass), without significant changes in energy intake, when there is increased leptin expression in the DVC. These findings suggest that the effect of leptin in the DVC is mainly due to its ability to increase energy expenditure rather than decreasing food intake. In terms of metabolic hormones, the studies suggest that DVC leptin expression has minimal to no impact on insulin, glucagon, or corticosterone levels. However, more research is needed to determine the specific effects on various metabolic hormones and pathways. In conclusion, increased leptin expression in the dorsal vagal complex may suppress adiposity, primarily through its impact on energy expenditure. Its effects on energy intake and metabolic hormones seem to be less significant or unclear. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the complex mechanisms and interactions behind leptin, the DVC, and their role in regulating adiposity and energy balance.", "This three-hour Chinese epic, set in 220 B.C., may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an Emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation, and there's nothing inherently challenging about the film, but it's a compelling narrative, crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes. Even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake, it's an astonishing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the coup attempt of the Marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory, and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy.

I think that I am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories. Oh, and this is gonna be a long post, I can tell already.First off, the people who said that the movie doesn't show real rugby, have a valid point. The movie is full of bad tackles, people in the wrong places, and much much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game feels like, you won't get the best idea from this movie. But the thing is, anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself, is not going to be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game? Not many that I have seen. I think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players, much more than it is about rugby.Next, the Haka is VERY much a part of Highland Rugby. It is not something that they just threw into the movie. To be honest, I don't know how the tradition got started, but Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is based off of the All Blacks as well. The movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the Haka, and to be honest, I don't think that that is right. But I can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China (?) who said that only a Maori can perform a Haka, I would suggest that they take a look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think that they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams. I, myself am part Hawaiian. Whenever possible, the Haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do it because they think that they are Maori, they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie. The concept of unity and \"those who have gone before\" is a huge part of the HR culture, and the message behind the Haka, for any of those that are familiar with it, support those values. It's a chant by a chief who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those around him supporting him telling him he will live (Ka Ora) and boosting him up. How appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say, but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done. \"Kia Kaha\" is also a well used team motto, even if the actors had a hard time saying it.Also, for the people who questioned Highland's Rugby playing ability, I would just remind you that you were not really watching Highland play in this movie. Many of the extras were former players from Highland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community. Granted, some years produce better teams than others (it's what you would expect with any sports team), but you don't accumulate HR's win record by just being okay. The year after I graduated, (1998) Highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the World Schools Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of High school rugby talent at the time. Highland obviously didn't win first place, (New Zealand did that), but they did manage to take third place in the tournament, beating the Tongan national champions in their last match. And while American rugby may never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about. Highland also has a tradition of touring New Zealand every few years, and usually comes back with more wins than losses.The majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and between the four of us, we were fairly certain that we were able to identify ALMOST every main character. Nobody knew a white Rasta. Of course as this wasn't a documentary, Hollywood did take some liberties, but to tell you the truth, not as many as you might think. The film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices, as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it really was running until you threw up. It also showed the service and other team activities (like the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were very much a part of team bonding.And finally the movie, in my (obviously very biased) opinion, it was a pretty good movie. And I think that the reason for it is that I watched it as an inspirational sports movie. I didn't think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama. It was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with morals, encouragement, and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment. I hope that I addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie, and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was.Kia Kaha", "Well, well, it seems like the newest entry into the action-packed thriller genre has arrived with \"Relentless Pursuit.\" This film may prove to be one of the surprise hits of the year, attributable to its deftly crafted plot, strong character development, and intense action sequences that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The movie follows protagonist Jake Collins, a former government agent whose world is turned upside down when an unknown adversary begins relentlessly targeting his friends and family. Desperate to protect his loved ones and unravel the truth behind the mysterious attacks, Collins embarks on a frantic race against time. Director Maria Stevens masterfully interweaves tension and heart-pounding action, creating a thrilling viewing experience. One particularly gripping scene involves an elaborate car chase through the streets of Los Angeles, complete with expertly executed stunts and aerial cinematography that would make even the Fast the Furious franchise envious. The film's true strength lies in its ability to balance the breakneck action with intimate moments of emotional depth, poignantly illustrating the fierce loyalty and love that drive Collins to confront his formidable foe. The performances of lead actor Tim Johnson, as Collins, and Ella Davis, as his estranged wife, deserve special mention, as their on-screen chemistry and commitment to their characters anchor the film. \"Relentless Pursuit\" may not completely reinvent the action-thriller genre, but it surely offers a fresh perspective on it. With its well-constructed plot, captivating performances, and relentless excitement, it is a must-see film that will undoubtedly get your adrenaline pumping and your heart racing.", "This soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. Of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on British society over the past twenty years, Eastenders is the prime example. For two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...How many times has someone or other remarked that Eastenders \"mirrors life\"? Life on which planet, exactly? It's written about \"working-class\" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. Eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the \"working-class\" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of Eastenders.This has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of Walford.Thus, it came to pass that Eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring Eastenders.Other soaps have followed in EE's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. This is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash.

Although results indicated that training with single cues can improve F0 discrimination within more complex sounds in which multiple cues vary, little improvement was seen when large variations in place were present, which suggests a diminishing effect of the training with increased influence of place-pitch. These data imply that although such training techniques may help listeners to follow melody in music, changes in instrument are likely to affect perception of melody. Results of subsequent training with complex sounds in which multiple cues varied were less conclusive and showed no further improvement. Follow-up evaluations with trainees conducted well after training had ceased verified the robustness of the training effect on F0 but not center frequency discrimination. Further studies are needed, however, to determine whether and to what degree subject motivation may be an important factor in these outcomes.", "All PDE5-i are equally effective and safe for the treatment of ED. On-demand use of any PDE5-i is also safe for patients with comorbid conditions. Tadalafil seems to be the preferred drug by patients and physicians, probably due to its peculiar pharmacological profile that makes sexual intercourse more spontaneous for the patients. Preliminary data suggest that the use of vardenafil may also be beneficial in cases of ED associated with premature ejaculation. Daily treatment is another option in men with ED and documented vascular or prostate disease. In geriatric or in difficult-to-treat populations, the evaluation of testosterone plasma levels will help to predict the efficacy of any PDE5-i.

Les Gones, the formidable force in French football until last year, stepped up their game with goals from Alexandre Lacazette and Mohamed Yattara. Their rise to the top comes as defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are in Champions League action against Barcelona. Lyon's position at the summit, however, could be short-lived, as PSG has a game in hand. The capital club is currently one point adrift, but their match against Monaco this weekend could see them catapult back to a familiar spot. The win over Bastia wasn't a straightforward one for Lyon, with substitute Yattara only managing to score in the 88th minute to ensure the victory. Leading scorer Lacazette, who was recently awarded the best Ligue 1 player, initially put Lyon ahead 25 minutes into the game. The team had to dig deep against their struggling opponents, who are trying to avoid relegation. Les Gones have been through a period of rebuilding since last year when they lost their league title for the first time in seven years. Under the guidance of experienced coach Hubert Fournier, they have shown impressive progress, displaying their capacity to take down the big names in French football. This season, Lyon have displayed their effectiveness on and off the field, particularly in the transfer market, where the signing of Brazilian midfielder Bruno Guimaraes proved to be a masterstroke. Guimaraes has played a vital role in augmenting the midfield's creativity, providing a solid base for the team's attacking talents. Lyon's resurgence to the summit of French football bodes well for the league, providing another competitive rival for PSG, who have been largely unchallenged at the top. The race for the Ligue 1 title is far from over, and given the unpredictable nature of football, fans can expect a thrilling and tense finish to the season.", "As you may know Norway is the most developed country in the world (regarding to HDI; Human Development Index).

The film takes a deep dive into the world of medical education and shows the pressure and challenges faced by both students and educators. Dr. Bock, brilliantly portrayed by veteran actor David Strathairn, is a shining example of dedication, empathy, and commitment in the field of medicine. His innovative teaching style and commitment to the healing art make him an incredible mentor and role model. The cinematography is visually appealing and captures the dynamic energy of a bustling hospital environment. Additionally, the film's score composed by Michael Andrews is compelling and adds a layer of emotional depth to the movie. The supporting cast, including Emma Watson as the ambitious and hardworking student Sarah, delivers strong performances that complement Strathairn's portrayal of the compassionate Dr. Bock.

Some studies have suggested that it could be a useful tool in identifying patients at risk of intestinal malperfusion, by continuously monitoring the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the gut mucosa. This could help to detect changes in blood flow to the intestines, which could indicate compromised perfusion. However, more research is needed to confirm the reliability and accuracy of this method in early detection of intestinal malperfusion, and to determine how it could be best applied in clinical settings.", "New York (CNN) When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York. A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband. Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared \"I do\" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other. In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her \"first and only\" marriage. Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of \"offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,\" referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam. On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further. After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002. All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say. Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages. Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted. The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called \"red-flagged\" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali. Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison. Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.", "This would probably be a good film to see...provided you've already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. \"Mindless Journey\" straddles the line between bad and utterly forgettable with a shocking lack of grace. Its lackluster and cliched plot will leave the audience questioning whether they've missed some sort of deep, hidden meaning - spoiler: they haven't. The characters are so two-dimensional and uninspiring that one wonders if the director chose them from a pool of the world's blandest stock characters. As a result, it's nearly impossible to invest in their fates, which is unfortunate, as the film insists on dragging the viewer through a labyrinth of tropes and hackneyed plot twists. The cinematography wavers between underwhelming and downright dizzying, leaving the viewer feeling somewhat seasick during what could have been visually captivating moments. Sadly, \"Mindless Journey\" fails to make the most of any potential aesthetic allure. The sole redeeming feature in this film may be its soundtrack, which is eclectic and interesting enough to momentarily distract the viewer from the mess of a story unfolding on screen. However, even music cannot save this film from being a tedious exercise in misplaced potential. In conclusion, if you've exhausted the entire universe of entertainment possibilities, and have somehow reached the point where watching \"Mindless Journey\" is your final option, do yourself a favor and pick up a good book instead. You'll thank yourself for it.", "Determinants of maternal near miss in an obstetric intensive care unit are factors that contribute to severe complications or life-threatening events experienced by pregnant women or new mothers during pregnancy or childbirth. These determinants may vary, but some common factors may increase the risk of a maternal near miss in an obstetric intensive care unit. Understanding these factors can help healthcare professionals identify patients at higher risk for severe maternal morbidities and implement appropriate interventions to prevent or manage complications. Some determinants of maternal near misses in obstetric intensive care units may include: 1. Demographic factors: Age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and level of education are some factors that may contribute to maternal near misses. For example, younger or older mothers may be at higher risk of complications during pregnancy or childbirth. 2. Pre-existing medical conditions: Women with pre-existing medical conditions such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, or other chronic illnesses may be at increased risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth. 3. Access to healthcare: Limited access to antenatal care, inadequate prenatal care, delayed referral to specialized care, and lack of skilled birth attendants can increase the risk of maternal near misses. 4. Quality of care: Poor quality of care, suboptimal management of obstetric emergencies, and lack of adherence to clinical guidelines or standard operating procedures can contribute to severe maternal morbidities. 5. Obstetric factors: Multiple gestations, preterm labor and delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, eclampsia, and sepsis are some obstetric factors that may lead to maternal near misses. Additionally, complications related to cesarean deliveries, such as infection or blood clots, can also be determinants of maternal near misses. 6. Behavioral and lifestyle factors: Substance abuse, smoking, and lack of physical activity during pregnancy can contribute to maternal near misses. 7. Inadequate infrastructure and resources: Limited access to essential drugs, equipment, and trained healthcare providers, as well as inadequate referral systems, can also contribute to maternal near misses. In conclusion, various determinants can contribute to maternal near misses in obstetric intensive care units. Healthcare professionals and policymakers need to focus on addressing these determinants and improving maternal care to reduce the risk of severe complications during pregnancy and childbirth.", "Roberto Martinez complained Seamus Coleman should have been awarded a free-kick before the Everton defender conceded the penalty that allowed Swansea to pinch a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Everton manager Martinez felt Coleman had been barged by home striker Marvin Emnes before the Irish right-back scooped away the ball with his hands. And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used 'common sense' to rule in favour of Everton. Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball . Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full-time whistle, but his manager says he was fouled . Martinez said on BT Sport 1: 'My thoughts are that straight away there is contact. Seamus tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced. 'Sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense. 'Clearly there's contact. I've seen it many times given as a free-kick. 'The whole action for me is too soft. I don't think that there's enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty. 'He's trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free-kick to be given. The Everton players protest but Michael Oliver deemed Coleman's handball deliberate, and gave a penalty . Jonjo Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder equalised for Swansea . 'It's one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion. 'You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end.' Martinez labelled the result 'a real disappointment', after Aaron Lennon's first-half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points. Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute. Martinez added: 'The only criticism is we had a period of 10, 15, 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn't find that final shot or try to score the second goal, but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn't reflect what happened.' Roberto Martinez was clearly angry with the referee's decision as his current side were held by his old club .", "Person1: I love when we have weather like this. It's perfect for a walk in the park.

On close ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get a headache. The cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himselfherself wondering what just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on, they end up losing. To me, this was a basically terrible movie, wrecked by a camera man with ADHD, and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot.", "Jenny Lewis delivers a captivating performance in her latest film, where she plays an awkward girl called Jade. Lewis expertly captures the essence of Jade, a young woman who is uncomfortable in her own skin and struggles to navigate the complexities of adolescence.

I had given up almost all hope when I stumbled upon the recommendation for Rollin's 1975 masterpiece \"Lips of Blood.\" I hesitantly hit the play button, but within a few minutes of the opening scene, I found myself completely captivated. This film developed a cohesive ambiance that showcased Rollin's exquisite talent in visual storytelling with a perfect balance of eroticism and horror. Vampires and seduction were evidently tailored to ensnare the viewer's emotions, leaving them vulnerable to the thrilling, blood-fueled dilemmas that unfold. The cinematography in \"Lips of Blood\" was breathtaking. The stark contrast between the modern urban settings and the haunting gothic atmosphere provided a brilliant backdrop for this tale of erotic horror. The use of vivid colors, shadowy corners, and fog-laden landscapes demonstrated Rollin's mastery in evoking terror and mystery. The performances by the leading actors, Jean-Loup Philippe and Annie Belle, were top-notch, showing a depth of emotion that added credibility to the wild premise. Philippe's portrayal of the protagonist searching for a powerful and seductive presence from his past was engaging, while Belle's mysterious and sensual role left a lasting impression. What truly stood out to me was the film's hauntingly beautiful original score by Didier William Lepauw, which intensified the overall experience and expertly guided the emotions throughout. The soundtrack added an elemental layer to the film that elevated it beyond the standard horror fare. While \"Lips of Blood\" may not be a perfect film - some narrative choices left me puzzled and wanting more - I was left with a newfound respect and admiration for Jean Rollin's work. I now understand why he is revered by fans of the Euro-trash genre. In conclusion, I am thrilled to have found a Rollin film that finally resonated with me and will undoubtedly urge me to explore more of his unique oeuvre with renewed enthusiasm.", "PLOT SPOILERS!!!!

Also there's a killer roaming the hospital. Then he meets VERY strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to run away with herbut can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one?Very strange movie with an Oscar winning script by Paddy Chayefsky. It presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors that is run incompetently. It manages (somehow) to actually make this seem pretty funny. It's not laugh out loud humorit's VERY black humor. Also the acting is right on targetScott is just great (and Oscar nominated) here. You see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. Riggs character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutalbut never too much. I think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the topbut it's still worth seeing. If this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a small bit and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in uncredited bits. I personally had trouble taking this seriously. From what I've heard hospitals WERE this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore. See it for the acting and script. I give it a 7.", "Musacchio Suffers Horror Injury as Villarreal and Getafe Share Points In a match that was overshadowed by a horror injury to Villarreal defender Mateo Musacchio, the home side drew 1-1 with Getafe at Estadio de la Ceramica on Sunday. The Argentine center-back suffered an ankle injury chasing after the ball, an incident that took a lot of attention away from the match's result. The match saw Villarreal manage to break their goal drought in La Liga, as Ikechukweu Uche scored their first goal in five league games. The Nigerian striker converted a penalty in the 24th minute, giving hope to the Yellow Submarine to secure a win. However, Getafe had other plans, as Diego Castro equalized in the second half, ensuring a point for the visitors and maintaining their position in the middle of the table. With 13 minutes left in the game, Mateo Musacchio snapped his ankle while trying to chase the ball down the right side. The injury appeared to be gruesome, and the player was immediately taken to the hospital to assess the damage. The shocking incident left both teams and spectators stunned, overshadowing the eventual draw. For Villarreal, who sit near the bottom of the league table, the single point was not enough to give them a much-needed boost. The team has been struggling in recent matches, and while the draw did end their losing streak at home, it was not the result they were hoping for. Meanwhile, Getafe continue to hold onto a mid-table position, with the draw preventing them from dropping into the relegation zone. As the La Liga season moves forward, Villarreal will need to find their form and secure more points to avoid relegation. While the injury to Mateo Musacchio will no doubt affect their defense, the team has more to focus on than just their backline. Scoring goals and finding consistent form will be vital for their survival in Spain's top flight. On the other hand, Getafe will look to build on the point and continue to push for a higher position in the table, eyeing a potential spot in European competitions.", "Person1: Well, I wouldn't say I'm a true art lover, but I do enjoy learning about different artists and their techniques.

Chelsea made two changes from the side that started the quarter-final victory over Atletico Madrid last month, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Charly Musonda coming into the line-up. Andreas Christensen, who started in midfield against Atletico, was paired with Jake Clarke-Salter at centre-back, while Ola Aina and Jay DaSilva occupied the full-back positions.

According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not be able to fulfill their upcoming tour dates. Migos were next due to perform at theKsu Convocation Center in Georgia before traveling on to a number of other states including Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York. From left to right: Hip hop rappers Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, andKiari Cephus, 23, have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after drugs and guns were found in their van . Authorities said that they suspected the music stars were in possession of drugs when 'a very potent smell' of marijuana was detected coming from their two tour buses. When Migos left to perform at Georgia Southern University's Hanner Fieldhouse arena over the weekend, investigators seized the opportunity to conduct a search. Multiple guns, marijuana and another undisclosed drug were discovered inside the vehicles, officials said. They added that the discoveries 'were intensely concerning' as they had been brought to a university-sponsored event where over a thousand students were congregated.

The three band members - best known for their 2013 single Versace and their 2014 track Fight Night - were arrested after leaving the stage. They reportedly face charges of drug possession; possession of firearms in a school safety zone; and possession of firearms during the commission of a crime. It wasn't known early Monday if they had attorneys. Phone calls and emails to the group's management team by the Associated Press were not immediately returned. About a dozen other suspects - all occupants of the two vans - were also taken into custody following the concert. Information about them and the charges they face were not immediately available.

PKA-C is known to undergo conformational changes upon binding to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and the presence of adenosine could potentially affect these conformational changes. However, the extent to which adenosine modulates this flexibility specifically in binary complexes is not well-established. Additionally, several other factors might lead to conformational flexibility, including the presence of other ligands, interactions with regulatory subunits, and post-translational modifications. To fully understand the role of adenosine in defining conformational flexibility, it may be necessary to evaluate the formation of the binary complex using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or other techniques that provide structural information about protein-ligand interactions. Furthermore, computational studies such as molecular dynamics simulations or docking studies can also help investigate conformational flexibility in the presence of adenosine. In summary, while a binary complex of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and adenosine could potentially provide insights into conformational flexibility, further experimental and computational studies are needed to fully understand the role of adenosine in this process.", "A woman emerged from a Melbourne restaurant late on Sunday night, after being held hostage for over seven hours by a disgruntled former employee. Police were called to the scene at the Riverside Quay in the city center shortly after 10pm when a 35-year-old man entered the restaurant's storeroom. Armed with a knife, the man calmly entered the storeroom and locked the door, taking a woman trapped inside as his hostage. By 5.30am Monday morning, the woman was released unharmed by her captor, as police waited outside the premises, doing their best to negotiate with the man. The situation prompted a large-scale police response, with several nearby buildings evacuated and nearby roads closed off to traffic. The area surrounding the restaurant remained cordoned off in the early hours of Monday, as negotiators spoke with the knife-wielding man throughout the night, hoping for a peaceful resolution to the situation. The man, known to employees of the restaurant, was described as \"disgruntled,\" though it remains unclear what specific grievances led to this hostage-taking incident. The man was taken into police custody following the ordeal but had yet to be charged. The situation has understandably shocked the local community, with many praising the police for their diligent handling of the situation and professionalism in bringing it to a peaceful end. The woman at the center of this traumatic event is said to be recovering well and grateful for the support offered by friends and family. As the investigation into the incident continues, it is hoped that answers can be provided as to the actions of this 35-year-old man, and that measures can be taken to ensure that such a harrowing ordeal is not repeated in the future.", "Retrobulbar vascular changes in nonexudative age-related macular degeneration subjects include reduced flow velocities in the nasal and temporal posterior ciliary arteries. The reduced peak systolic velocity, combined with the reduced end diastolic velocity at a constant resistive index, seen in nonexudative age-related macular degeneration, is consistent with reduced bulk flow in these vessels, suggesting that choroidal perfusion is abnormal in this form of age-related macular degeneration. The changes in the central retinal artery suggest there may be a more generalized perfusion abnormality beyond the choroid in patients with age-related macular degeneration or that the central retinal artery exhibits a secondary autoregulatory response to a primary change elsewhere.", "Oral contraceptives can potentially impact the epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, and the function of immune cells like monocyte-derived macrophages. Studies investigating the effects of oral contraceptives on DNA methylation have found alterations in the methylation profiles of certain genes. These changes may in turn be associated with modifications in the immune response and functioning of immune cells like macrophages. However, current research on this topic is limited and has mainly been focused on the effects of oral contraceptives on DNA methylation patterns and immune function in general rather than specifically on monocyte-derived macrophage function. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex relationship between oral contraceptives, DNA methylation changes, and the immune response, including the function of monocyte-derived macrophages.", "An insane assault on viewers' senses, \"Chaos World\" takes the audience on a wild, disorienting ride that defies stereotypical cinema. The director, John Smith, manages to weave a complex labyrinth of storylines, action-packed sequences, and mind-bending visuals that keep the viewers on their toes from start to finish. As we traverse through the high-stakes world of the protagonist, Alex Turner, we find ourselves constantly questioning reality and the blurred lines of morality. The film's attention to detail is commendable, and the vivid neon color palette leaves a lasting imprint on the audience's mind. The performances by the ensemble cast are also top-notch, with each character adding a new layer of intrigue and depth. Jane Doe, who plays the enigmatic Maya, truly steals the show with her evocative acting and magnetic screen presence. The movie's sound design is of particular note. The integration of an electrifying electronic score perfectly complements the film's dystopian themes and helps enhance the overall viewing experience. However, \"Chaos World\" is not for the faint-hearted. The film's relentless pacing, bewildering narrative, and intense visual effects could be overwhelming for some viewers. While it doesn't cater to everyone, its bold nature and fearless storytelling set it apart from other films in its genre. In conclusion, \"Chaos World\" is a thrilling, sensorial tour de force that leaves viewers both exhilarated and exhausted. It's the kind of movie that demands multiple viewings to fully grasp its intricacies, but those brave enough to embark on this mind-bending journey will surely not be disappointed. Prepare yourself for an unforgettable cinematic experience - if you dare.", "IKK acts independent of its kinase activity to help drive chondrocyte differentiation towards a hypertrophic-like state. IKK positively modulates ECM remodeling via multiple downstream targets (including MMP-10 and TIMP-3 at the mRNA and post-transcriptional levels, respectively) to maintain maximal MMP-13 activity, which is required for ECM remodeling leading to chondrocyte differentiation. Chondrocytes are the unique cell component in articular cartilage, which are quiescent and maintain ECM integrity during tissue homeostasis. In OA, chondrocytes reacquire the capacity to proliferate and differentiate and their activation results in pronounced cartilage degeneration. , our findings are also of potential relevance for defining the onset andor progression of OA disease.", "Minocycline has been shown to have potential neuroprotective effects by reducing neuroinflammation induced by diabetic metabolic disorder. Studies have suggested that minocycline might alleviate beta-amyloid protein and tau pathology, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This, in turn, could help restrain neuroinflammation caused by diabetic metabolic disorders. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms through which minocycline interacts with these pathologies and to confirm its therapeutic potential in this context.", "THE DEADLY MANTIS certainly won't scare any one, but as sci-fi programmers go it is better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant, prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole. Military men go missing.

ANXA2-antigen fusion peptides could be developed for patients as \"off-the-shelf\" agents containing common tumor antigens. Alternatively, they could be \"personalized\" and synthesized after tumor sequencing to identify immunogenic tumor-specific neo-antigens. As the amino terminal 15 amino acids of ANXA2 are required to stimulate TLR2 activity, a fusion peptide could be as short as 30 amino acids if one or two CD8 T cell epitopes are fused to the ANXA2 amino terminal portion. Future work will address the efficacy of ANXA2 peptide fusions alone and in combination with established TLR agonists to induce synergy in preclinical models of glioma as observed in other vaccines.", "Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was, in a word, \"insane.\" After watching it, I couldn't agree more. This twisted and bizarre cult classic certainly lives up to its reputation. Directed by John Waters, Pink Flamingos features the iconic Divine as Babs Johnson, a larger-than-life character who, along with her eccentric family, contests for the title of \"the filthiest person alive.\" The film is a riot of outrageousness, with a plot filled with unforgettable and depraved moments that challenge the boundaries of taste and decency. The exaggerated, campy performances by the actors, especially Divine and Mink Stole, contribute to the film's unique and unforgettable charm. Despite the absurdity of the situations they face, the actors deliver their lines with sincerity and conviction that make the film captivating. Of course, Pink Flamingos is notorious for its controversial and disgusting scenes, including the infamous \"dog feces\" scene that still stands as one of the most repulsive moments in film history. Consequently, this film is not for the faint-hearted or easily offended. From a technical standpoint, Pink Flamingos boasts a low-budget, lo-fi style that adds to the film's authenticity. The grainy, gritty visual quality and the unusually effective use of an eclectic soundtrack elevate the unsettling ambiance. Pink Flamingos is undoubtedly a cult classic that must be approached with caution. This shocking and unforgettable film may not cater to everyone's taste, but it is impossible to deny that it has left an indelible mark on underground cinema.", "Yes, modulation of the human gut microbiota by dietary fibers occurs at the species level. Dietary fibers are complex carbohydrates that resist digestion in the human small intestine and reach the large intestine, where they are fermented and metabolized by the gut microbiota. Different types of dietary fibers, such as soluble and insoluble fibers, have different effects on the gut microbial composition. Some dietary fibers serve as prebiotics, selectively promoting the growth and activity of beneficial bacterial species, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. The fermentation of these fibers produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have numerous health benefits, including modulation of immune function, regulation of inflammation, and maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier. Other fibers that are not readily fermented or metabolized can still have an impact on the gut microbiota by modulating transit time in the gut, altering the gut environment, or providing a physical scaffold for bacterial colonization. Overall, the effect of dietary fibers on the gut microbiota is complex and varies depending on the specific type of fiber and the individual's existing gut microbial composition. However, it is clear that dietary fibers have the potential to modulate the gut microbiota at the species level, contributing to overall gut health and host physiology.", "Fires on the Plain, directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada, is a World War Two movie that refreshingly veers away from the typical narrative of allies fighting the axis powers, and instead, delves into the lives of Japanese soldiers and their struggle for survival in the Philippines. Impeccably shot in black and white, the movie portrays a visceral account of the human cost of war and the desperate measures undertaken by these soldiers in their quest for sustenance. With the lack of supplies and on the verge of defeat, these men grapple with their morality and the harrowing impact of war on camaraderie. The evocative and haunting score by Yasushi Akutagawa perfectly compliments the bleak atmosphere, whilst enabling audiences to feel the raw emotions of fear, trauma, and despair. In turn, Eiji Funakoshi's earnest portrayal of Tamura, one of the lead characters, grips viewers as they empathize with his internal battle between ethics and survival. Ichikawa expertly utilizes the vast landscape of the Philippines to create an unnerving tension, punctuating the air of hopelessness and desolation felt by these doomed soldiers. The film further poses thought-provoking questions about the true meaning of loyalty during wartime and the ultimate price paid for adhering to a nationalistic mentality. Fires on the Plain is a powerful and intense war film that daringly explores the lesser-seen side of World War Two. It strips away the glory of heroism and focuses on the devastating consequences faced by those caught up in the raging storm. Through Ichikawa's masterful direction, Ooka and Wada's gripping screenplay, and heartbreaking performances from the cast, this film deeply resonates and leaves a lasting impression on audiences. In conclusion, Fires on the Plain is a must-see for anyone interested in the complexities of wartime and the stories that often go untold. It is a heart-wrenching and profound cinematic experience that demands contemplation and encourages discourse on the true implications of war.", "Person1: Thank you.

In general, users of bone substitutes should conduct preclinical tests in order to obtain advance information on the properties of possible replacement material. Since there can be varying interactions between the materials studied and bacterial growth, material-specific effects on bacterial growth should be investigated.

The treatment of fibromyalgia mainly focuses on managing symptoms and improving the overall quality of life. Pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia has evolved over the years, currently incorporating both traditional and newer medications. Here is an update on the latest advancements and options in pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia. 1. Approved medications The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following medications specifically for the treatment of fibromyalgia: - Pregabalin (Lyrica): Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and a central nervous system depressant used to manage neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and partial onset seizures. Pregabalin is believed to act on the -2- subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, thus controlling pain and improving sleep in fibromyalgia patients. - Duloxetine (Cymbalta): Duloxetine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that alters the balance of these neurotransmitters in the brain, thereby reducing pain and improving mood in people with fibromyalgia. - Milnacipran (Savella): Milnacipran is another SNRI approved for fibromyalgia. It works similar to Duloxetine but with a higher selectivity for norepinephrine than serotonin. Milnacipran has been shown to improve pain, fatigue, and overall functioning in fibromyalgia patients. 2. Off-label medications Several off-label medications are frequently prescribed to manage fibromyalgia symptoms, including: - Antidepressants: Besides the approved SNRIs, other antidepressants, such as tricyclics (e.g., amitriptyline) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., fluoxetine), have also been used to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. - Other anticonvulsants: Apart from pregabalin, gabapentin has shown some benefits in reducing pain, fatigue, and improving sleep quality in fibromyalgia patients. - Low-dose naltrexone: Although not approved for fibromyalgia, low-dose naltrexone has demonstrated promising results in reducing chronic pain and inflammation in certain cases. - Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine, can help reduce muscle pain and improve sleep. 3. Emerging medications Research continues to explore new pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia. Some medications currently under investigation include: - Cannabinoids: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that cannabinoids (found in medical marijuana and CBD oil) hold potential for the treatment of fibromyalgia by reducing pain, inflammation, and improving sleep quality. - Mirogabalin: Similar to pregabalin, this novel drug targets the -2- subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. - NK1 receptor antagonists: These drugs, like serlopitant and orvepitant, target the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, which mediates pain transmission, and may be useful in managing chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia. In conclusion, pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia primarily focuses on the management of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. While current medications provide relief for many patients, not all individuals with fibromyalgia respond to existing treatments, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this field.", "Prince Harry Honors Unknown Australian Soldier Before Military Attachment Begins Canberra - Prince Harry paid a moving tribute to the unknown Australian soldier at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra shortly before he began his four-week attachment with the Australian military. A large crowd of well-wishers gathered to witness the young royal's tribute, with some of them even serenading him with the Australian Army's \"I've been everywhere\" anthem. In the course of his visit, Prince Harry, who is also known as Captain Harry Wales, laid a wreath at the tomb and observed a minute's silence. His handwritten message on the wreath read: \"In memory of the Gallipoli campaign and all those who have given their lives for our countries. Prince Harry.\" The tomb honors an unidentified Australian soldier killed on the Western Front in World War I, and represents all Australians who have been killed in the line of duty. During his attachment with the Australian military, the British prince is expected to spend time with units in Darwin, Perth, and Sydney. Among his planned activities are flying helicopters and taking part in indigenous engagement activities, including getting involved with the military's bush survival and digger training. The focus for Prince Harry during this time will be on learning about Australia's domestic counter-terrorism efforts, as well as getting briefed on their regional security concerns. This attachment comes ahead of Prince Harry's departure from the British Army in June, after a decade of full-time service. While in Australia, the prince is scheduled to make a short visit to Turkey alongside his father, Prince Charles, in order to represent Queen Elizabeth II at the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign between April 24-25. This significant historic event is seen as the beginning of Australia and New Zealand's emerging national consciousness formed during World War I. Before his military attachment begins, Prince Harry is expected to meet with some of the personnel and their families at the British embassy in Canberra, showcasing his dedication to military service and the sacrifices made by those who serve.", "Jack Higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into \"one last job\" (where have I heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church keep Father Bob from talking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They bond at the church organ. What? Really, that's the plot. Alan Bates is around as the top dog mobster who's calling the shots (literally) and he seems to be the only actor who's on to the jokey tone Hodges is aiming at.

Studies have shown that a high-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation causes an increase in adiposity, while post-weaning exposure to a high-fat diet leads to changes in body fat distribution and an increase in visceral fat deposits. Additionally, maternal and post-weaning high-fat diet exposure can lead to hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver. These findings suggest that early-life exposure to a high-fat diet can have long-term effects on the metabolic health of offspring, increasing the risk of obesity and related metabolic disorders in adulthood.", "The results presented here demonstrate that the ability of MHC class II to modulate gastric epithelial apoptosis is at least partially dependent on its crosslinking. Furthermore, while previous research has demonstrated that MHC class II signaling can be pro-apoptotic during extended ligation, we have shown that the crosslinking of this molecule has anti-apoptotic effects during the earlier time points of H pylori infection. This effect is possibly mediated by the ability of MHC class II to modulate the activation of the pro-apoptotic receptor Fas by blocking the recruitment of the accessory molecule FADD, and this delay in apoptosis induction could allow for prolonged cytokine secretion by H pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells.", "It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of \"acting adult\" is not engaging in sensuality. Instead, these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema.

The reversal of ophthalmic artery flow indicates that blood is flowing from the external carotid artery (ECA) to the ophthalmic artery to compensate for reduced blood flow in the ICA, which is a sign of severe carotid stenosis. While the sensitivity of this technique may be relatively low, its specificity can be quite high, suggesting that a positive finding is strongly indicative of the presence of severe ICA stenosis. However, it is essential to consider a comprehensive evaluation, including clinical examination, carotid duplex imaging, and if necessary, additional imaging modalities such as CT angiography or MR angiography to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment.", "Person1: Mr. Wilson.

This story of a mixed-race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties, and, as it often did, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then.. (Think, for example, of the casting of Ava Gardner in \"Show Boat\" or Natalie Wood in \"West Side Story The setting of the story in a British colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man, whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism was made the whipping-boy for some of America's own failings. Imagine the furore that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed-race woman doctor in a hospital in Alabama.Besides racial issues, the film also raises questions of international politics, referring to both the Communist seizure of power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in reality she tended to support Mao's Communist regime, but here she is shown as firmly anti-Communist. This is not, however, primarily an \"issue\" movie about either racialism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known at the time as a \"woman's picture.\" Such films, although mostly made by male directors, were mostly aimed at female audiences. They dealt with love and romance- often unhappy romance- from the woman's point of view, and had a strong female character in the leading role. The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. Earlier examples were normally in monochrome, but by the fifties they generally, as here, used lush, sumptuous colour.Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role, Jennifer Jones, does a very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden, as Mark, rather uncharismatic, but this does not matter much as Suyin is very much the dominant figure. She is screen much more than Mark, and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his. Although Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. Holden was about the same age, unusually for the fifties when \"boy-meets-girl\" often meant \"older man meets girl.\"The film is not particularly profound, but is well-made with some attractive photography, particularly of Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets. Seldom can Hong Kong have looked so beautiful; the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning, as this is where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic assignments. The overall mood is one of poignant, doomed romance, a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 710", "It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. This movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. The box lies, this is no \"erotic thriller,\" hell during the film's 97 minute running time, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would pick up once William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. This movie fails in pretty much every way. Claudio Simonetti's music is little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense at all. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by ghosts which attack using phones. (?) By the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through, and casually laugh as they sick the evil spirits on someone else, Lewis's ex-boyfriend. What?!? This movie did little for me besides anger me.... and bore me half to death.

Charlie Pye, from Leamington Spa, applied for the Villa hotseat after Paul Lambert was sacked in February. The Villa fan wanted a chocolate bar as a win bonus and would have agreed terms for a signed claret and blue football, a WWE wrestling figure and some sweets. Sherwood wrote Charlie a letter congratulating him on his credentials, despite missing out on the job. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood (centre) showed his softer side by replying to 6-year-old Charlie Pye . He wrote: 'From your letter it is clear to see that you would indeed be an ideal candidate for the job due to your knowledge of the game - and your very capable backroom staff, of course! 'Hopefully you're not too disappointed at missing out and I'm informed that I just managed to pip you to the post so you were very close to being offered the job.

Charlie had written to chief executive Tom Fox after Lambert was sacked with Villa in the relegation zone earlier this year. Pye is captain of Norton Lindsey and got a special message from Sherwood about being a captain . He wrote: 'I would appoint my mum and dad as assistant managers so they can drive me to the training ground each day. My mum is also very good at making bacon sandwiches for the players if that helps.' Charlie told the club's official site: 'I never expected a letter from the manager but I was absolutely delighted to get one. 'What he wrote was brilliant - it meant a lot to me.

While MVD is generally an effective treatment for hemifacial spasm, there are potential risks and complications associated with the procedure, including hearing loss. Hearing loss, particularly high-frequency hearing loss, is a possible complication after MVD surgery. The reported incidence of postoperative hearing loss varies widely across different studies, ranging from 0 to 46. High-frequency hearing loss occurs when a patient has difficulty hearing sounds at higher frequencies, typically above 2000 Hz. It is important to note that the risk of hearing loss after MVD is generally considered to be low. Several factors can influence the risk of hearing loss after MVD, including the surgical technique, the surgeon's experience, and the patient's individual anatomy. Preservation of hearing function is usually a priority during MVD surgery, and surgeons take various measures to minimize the risk of hearing loss, such as using intraoperative monitoring of auditory function and gentle microsurgical techniques to protect the facial and cochlear nerves, which are responsible for facial movements and hearing, respectively. Despite the risk of high-frequency hearing loss after MVD, the procedure is generally considered safe and effective for treating hemifacial spasm, resolving symptoms in the majority of patients. Patients considering MVD should discuss the potential risks and benefits of the surgery with their healthcare team to make an informed decision about treatment.", "Person1: That's true. What online platforms do you usually use for shopping? Person2: I mostly use Amazon, eBay, and sometimes Walmart.

In his recent press conference, the Portuguese tactician highlighted the intense competitiveness of the Premier League, stating that the English top flight is unmatched in terms of the challenges it presents to its participating teams. Currently leading the pack in the Premier League with a significant points difference, Chelsea have emerged as the favourites to clinch the coveted title by the end of the season. This journey began with a series of impressive performances by the Blues, characterized by a strong defence, swift counterattacking tactics, and a clinical ability to score goals when needed. Mourinho emphasized that the Premier League is filled with world-class talent, with several clubs investing heavily in acquiring the services of top footballers from across the globe. \"The Premier League's competitiveness is like no other. The level of quality among the teams, the talent arriving each season - it makes it very challenging for any club to maintain its momentum through the entire campaign,\" said Mourinho. As the season progresses, it is essential for Chelsea to continue their winning ways, especially against fellow title contenders. This weekend, the Blues face a tricky encounter with Queens Park Rangers (QPR) as they look to further consolidate their position on top of the league standings. Although QPR signifies an opportunity for Chelsea to exploit their opponents' weaknesses and maintain their stronghold atop the league, Mourinho stressed the importance of staying focused on the task at hand without caving under external pressures. \"We have a long way to go in the season, and it's vital for us to stay grounded and concentrate on one game at a time. Facing QPR this Sunday won't be an easy task, but my players are well-prepared to give their all and work for a positive result,\" concluded Mourinho. As the tight race for supremacy at the top of the Premier League continues, Chelsea supporters worldwide will be optimistic about their team's chances of clinching the title, especially given the unerring consistency they have displayed so far this season.", "Early coronary revascularization can potentially diminish the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Early revascularization, which includes procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aims to restore blood flow in the blocked coronary arteries, thus minimizing the damage to the heart muscle and improving patient outcomes. Several studies have suggested that early revascularization is beneficial in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in AMI patients. In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, it was found that early PCI significantly decreased the risk of stroke within the first 30 days in patients with AMI, compared to those who received initial medical therapy. However, it is essential to consider that the decision to pursue early revascularization should be based on individual patient factors, such as the extent of coronary artery disease, the presence of other medical conditions, and the overall risk-benefit profile. In conclusion, early coronary revascularization may potentially diminish the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but the decision to pursue this intervention should be tailored to each patient's unique clinical circumstances.", "Delta Airlines Introduces Pet GPS for Improved Animal Welfare In an effort to improve animal welfare and reduce the number of pet casualties during flights, Delta Airlines has introduced a pet GPS system that allows pet owners to monitor carriers conditions like temperature. The pet GPS is available for 50 per flight and currently serves 10 U.S. airports. Between 2010 and 2013, Delta Airlines was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported pet deaths during air travel. In response to these alarming numbers and increased public concern, the airline has invested in GPS technology specifically designed for pets. This new system will give pet owners real-time information on their pets' well-being, including crucial factors like temperature, throughout the duration of the flight. The pet GPS service is now available at the following airports: Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, Minneapolis, Seattle, LaGuardia, JFK, and Salt Lake City. Delta Airlines plans to expand the availability of this technology in the near future to serve more airports and destinations in the U.S. and international locations. \"We know that pets are family members, and we understand how important it is for our customers to have peace of mind when their pets are traveling with us,\" said a spokesperson for Delta Airlines. \"The pet GPS is just one of many steps we are taking to enhance the pet travel experience and ensure that all animals onboard our flights are treated with the utmost care.\" In addition to the pet GPS, Delta Airlines is also implementing new policies and procedures to ensure the safe handling of pets during travel. This includes mandatory temperature control requirements and ventilation systems in all animal holding areas, stricter adherence to animal wellness regulations, and specialized training for all airline staff who handle pets. \"We are committed to providing the best possible care for all pets that travel with us,\" said the spokesperson. \"Our new pet GPS system reflects that commitment and will help reassure pet owners that their animals are safe and comfortable during their flights with Delta Airlines.\" Pet owners have welcomed this new technology on social media, praising Delta Airlines for taking steps to ensure the well-being of their pets during air travel. As more airlines invest in similar technology and practices, the future of pet travel looks promising, with animal welfare being a top priority for companies and customers alike.", "The elderly husband of one of two women stabbed to death in a Victorian hair salon nearly 24 years ago, is in custody after facing court charged with their murders.

Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,' sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging 2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around 2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just 1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just 10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company.

One potential explanation for this finding is that both collars may serve as proprioceptive guides, which allow patients to regulate their own cervical motion based on their level of comfort. Given the paucity of data supporting the use of postoperative bracing, especially after procedures which incorporate internal fixation, this study indicates that a rigid orthosis may be unnecessary in many cases because even a soft collar seems to be sufficient for restricting motion during routine activities until the normal, physiologic ROM of the cervical spine has been restored.", "Hazmat teams tested a white powdery substance sent to U.S. Rep Mike Doyle's office on Wednesday causing the building to temporarily close down.

In less than two weeks, three local banks have been robbed at gunpoint, with robbers threatening tellers and customers with kidnapping. The FBI has joined hands with the Pittsburgh police to bring these criminals to justice. Witnesses shared chilling accounts of the daring heists, in which the criminals displayed a brazen disregard for public safety. In each of the robberies, the criminals entered the banks with their faces covered and brandished handguns at the terrified tellers, demanding money. The most recent theft took a turn for the worse when the criminals began to threaten customers they would be kidnapped if their demands were not met promptly. Police are not revealing exact amounts stolen in any of the three robberies, but it is believed that the criminals have made off with substantial sums each time. Disturbingly, one of the criminals has displayed knowledge of police weapon safety methods and appears to be well-trained. The FBI is analyzing security camera footage and eyewitnesses' accounts to determine if any of the suspects are ex-law enforcement officers or military personnel. The holster used by one of the gunmen is of particular interest, as it is commonly used by police officers to safely carry their weapons. Local residents are understandably concerned for their safety and local businesses are taking extra precautions to try and protect their employees and customers. Some banks have increased security measures in response to the attacks. Authorities are urging residents to stay vigilant and report any suspicious activity they may come across. They say it is only a matter of time before the masked gunmen are brought to justice. \"We are utilizing all available resources to identify and apprehend those responsible for these heinous acts,\" a spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Police Department said in a statement released earlier today. \"The safety of our citizens is our top priority, and we will not rest until these criminals are apprehended and brought to justice.\" As the investigation continues, there is a heightened atmosphere of fear among local residents. Many are choosing to alter their daily routines to reduce their risk of encountering the violent criminals. The police and the FBI are urging anyone with information to come forward and assist in bringing these criminals to justice. As these robberies continue to escalate in violence, the need for law enforcement agencies to swiftly apprehend the gunmen becomes ever more pressing.

The storyline lacks depth, and the plot relies far too heavily on cliches and illogical events. The characters feel shallow and forced, with their relationships appearing strained and unnatural. It's a shame, really, because the film's visuals and special effects had potential. The aerial stunts could have been impressive if not for the unrealistic flying sequences and lack of attention to detail regarding aviation standards. The acting is also a mixed bag, with some performers delivering passionate performances, while others seem to deliver lines with no emotional connection to the material. In particular, the film's leads appear to struggle with their roles, leaving audiences feeling disconnected from their plights. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film, however, is the pointless subplots and irrelevant material thrown in to pad the runtime. The unrelated scenes detract from the central narrative and feel like a feeble attempt to capture more breadth. In conclusion, this film is a disappointing waste of time for those expecting a thrilling, well-written tale of aviation prowess and adventure. Its faulty execution, misguided storylines, and lack of authenticity make for a forgettable cinematic experience.

Director Alejandro Sanchez masterfully utilizes the colors and textures of the Spanish land to reflect the characters' introspections and personal journeys. \"Suenos de Esperanza\" offers a rich and diverse cast, weaving their stories together in a tapestry of love, heartbreak, and resilience. Newcomer Adriana Alvarez delivers a powerful portrayal of the protagonist, Lucia, a young woman determined to break free from the suffocating small-town life and societal expectations. Her performance is both haunting and hopeful, perfectly capturing the complexities and depth of her character. The supporting cast members brilliantly depict various dimensions of life in rural Spain, each grappling with their own personal struggles. Through their interactions and conflicts, the viewer is taken on an emotional rollercoaster that blends humor, tragedy, and the human will to overcome adversity. One of the standout elements in \"Suenos de Esperanza\" is the film's exquisite use of music, combining traditional Spanish melodies with original compositions that enrich the storytelling and experience. Composer Jose Antonio Carmona creates a memorable score that resonates with the audience throughout the film, transporting them to the world and emotions vividly portrayed onscreen. In conclusion, \"Suenos de Esperanza\" is a tale both timeless and contemporary, beautifully crafted and undeniably deserving of its spot in this year's Oscar race. It is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit and the universal need to find one's purpose, regardless of the hardships and obstacles that may arise.

While unharmed, the massive animal found himself stranded and unable to get out of the water. The Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service responded to the scene, dispatching a team of firefighters to assist in the rescue operation.

The distressed equine had wandered onto a residential property and subsequently fallen into the homeowner's swimming pool. Sussex Fire and Rescue Service responders arrived at the scene and found the horse struggling in the water, unable to escape on its own.

Bosses at Queen's Hospital, Burton, Staffordshire, admitted they didn't tell relatives about the arrangement and a spokesman has claimed the use of a lorry is normal practice across the country. Bodies were transferred to the mortuary for viewings, then returned to the truck, according to one hospital worker. Temporary mortuary: The refrigerated lorry - where bodies were stored after the hospital ran out of space in its mortuary over the Easter weekend - parked outside Queen's Hospital in Burton, Staffordshire . Queen's Hospital in Staffordshire said it experienced an unprecedented number of deaths over the Easter weekend. Relatives were not told about the arrangement to use a refrigerated lorry as a temporary mortuary . The hospital said there were an unprecedented number of deaths over the Easter bank holiday weekend, with many undertakers closed during the four-day break. A hospital spokesman said families were not informed that their deceased relatives were kept in the refrigerated truck over the bank holiday period as it treated the temporary service as an extension of its fixed mortuary. Chief operating officer for Burton Hospitals Trust, Brendan Brown, defended the use of the lorry . Brendan Brown, chief operating officer for Burton Hospitals Trust, said that the temporary mortuary service adhered to the same robust standards and regulations as the normal mortuary. He said: 'Our priority is always patient care and ensuring that our patients and their relatives are treated with dignity and respect at all times. 'This approach extends to any essential contingency planning we may need to do as a trust, for example, the need to install temporary mortuary services when required, to help us increase capacity when faced with increased demand for those services. 'Putting the needs of patients and their families first was the basis for our decision to employ the use of temporary mortuary facilities.' Mr Brown added that the temporary facility was no longer on site as it was brought in only as and when required. A spokesman said the use of a refrigerated lorry was normal practice at hospitals across the country and, as most undertakers were closed on bank holidays, the hospital mortuary had filled up. A hospital employee said: 'Bodies were being viewed in the mortuary by relatives and then they were being transferred into this trailer and put on beds.'", "A giant hammerhead shark swims in the shallows off Destin, Florida, chasing after its next meal while two oblivious swimmers bask in the crystal clear water just feet away. 'Get out the water!' cries a man with a group of friends on a penthouse balcony overlooking the beach, and for a long time to no avail, until they finally spot the danger as the shark's chase leads it too close to them for comfort. While the likelihood that serious injury would have been very unlikely should the shark have turned its attentions to them, the swimmers weren't willing to stick around to confirm it. Two swimmers stand oblivious to a hammerhead shark as it hunts a fish in the shallows off Florida . The swimmers were shouted at to get out of the water by a group of men standing on a penthouse balcony . Hammerheads are largely harmless to humans, but the swimmers were willing to stick around to prove it . 'Yeah, now run,' said one of the group of men watching and filming the shark as it displayed the full range of its agility in pursuit of the fish, perhaps a small stingray, one of the species' favourite foods. 'I think they finally figured it out,' said another of the residents at the Silver Beach Towers. 'That is a massive shark, and it came all the way up to knee level.' Destin is a resort town in Okaloosa County, Florida, on the peninsula that separates the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. While their hearts may have been racing once they were safely on the beach, the Florida Museum of Natural History's International Shark Attack File lists 17 unprovoked attacks on humans by hammerheads, with none of them fatal. 'Yeah, now run,' said one of the group of men watching as the hammerhead ramped up its chase of the fish . The swimmers are surely relieved once on shore, although serious injury was highly unlikely . Only three of the 11 known species of hammerhead are believed to be hostile to humans, the scalloped, great, and smooth hammerheads. It's a different story with great white, tiger or bull sharks, which are considered the \"Big Three\" when it comes to shark attacks claiming the majority of fatalities for swimmers and surfers.", "Non-disruptive tactics of suppression can be effective in countering terrorism, insurgency, and financial panics; however, it ultimately depends on the specific context and factors involved. In some cases, non-disruptive tactics, such as diplomacy, negotiation, and economic sanctions, can be effective in defusing tensions and shutting down terrorist networks, insurgencies, or financial crises. These tactics can be seen as more sustainable and less likely to cause collateral damage than forceful, disruptive methods. However, in other situations, these non-disruptive tactics might not be sufficient or fast-acting in countering the threat in question, and more immediate, forceful actions might be necessary. In cases where the adversaries are unwilling to negotiate, disruptive tactics, like targeted strikes or financial interventions, might be more effective. It is important to consider the causes driving the underlying issues of terrorism, insurgency, and financial panics. Instead of focusing solely on suppression, a multifaceted approach addressing the root causes, including social and economic factors, is crucial to achieving long-term stability and success. In summary, non-disruptive tactics can be an effective tool in countering terrorism, insurgency, and financial panics, but should be complemented by a range of other measures to address the complexities and root causes of these issues. A well-informed, flexible, and adaptive approach is likely to yield the best results in each unique situation.", "Person1: what shall we do after the volleyball match?

The Drama! The Tension! Where does one begin with this atrocity? Let's start with the \"judges\" who were known as \"Music Experts\" on this program. \"Experts\" implies they have expertise. Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a time. The other two... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And The Paula Abdul wannabe, who did something I didn't think could happen: she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode. The farce of \"critiques\" that these three offered was a true joke and an insult, not only to the process of finding the best singer, but to the audience that is now quite savvy, already having done this numerous times on Fox.There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as lackluster as can be. He actually sucked what little energy there was in the program, dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show.The first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talent-free talent show. OK. Perhaps that's an exaggeration. And granted, the performers all have to be relatively close in ability, because if they were not, there wouldn't be a \"contest.\" If only one person was \"good,\" there would be no \"suspense.\" So, I get that they all needed to be comparable. But they all should have had some chops! Additionally, the judges were running a \"Singing Academy,\" so the program was part \"Fame,\" as well. Clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons. But you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that definitely wasn't what was happening here.It seemed in casting the show, the priority was on the \"homelife\" elements, as all of the players were very attractive to look at, in equal parts to how badly they vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced, you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen, so the show didn't capture the events there, either.As badly devised as all of that was, \"The One\" had an incredible, unbelievable, fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable.The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best, just like on \"AI.\" But then, after the audience vote was revealed, the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song. The \"music experts,\" based on that performance, chose one person from the three to save for the following week. And THEN, the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two, sending the remaining contestant home.The \"design flaw\" was that the contestants had the final say. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could, would you vote to KEEP the better singer, or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first season viewer of CBS's \"Survivor\" could answer that one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost, and the contestants voted back \"the one\" who had no talent at all! On top of that, the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the \"experts\" was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! Maybe if they let the contestants vote first, at least the \"experts\" would save the better of two evils to finish. But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast, how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it.", "Person1: That's interesting. What inspired you to focus on green products specifically? Person2: I've always been passionate about the environment and sustainability. Plus, I noticed that there was a growing demand for eco-friendly products, but not enough companies were meeting that need. So, I decided to create a company that would not only cater to this demand but also promote a greener and more sustainable lifestyle. Person1: That's a great initiative. What challenges did you face when starting your own business? Person2: There were many challenges along the way - from securing funding and finding the right suppliers to building a solid team and dealing with unforeseen obstacles like regulatory issues. But the biggest challenge was probably overcoming self-doubt and having the confidence to pursue my dreams. Person1: It seems like your hard work has paid off.

Do you have any advice for aspiring entrepreneurs who want to start their own green business? Person2: Absolutely. First, I'd say do your research - find out what's already available in the market and identify any gaps you can fill. Second, be prepared to work hard and learn from your mistakes.

Person2: Hm, I don't mind going again, but let's see what the others think as well.", "I liked this show from the first episode I saw, which was the \"Rhapsody in Blue\" episode (for those that don't know what that is, the Zan going insane and becoming pau lvl 10 ep). This thrilling roller coaster of an episode had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and I knew immediately that I was in for a treat with the rest of the series. What strikes me most about the show is its unique blend of stunning visuals and compelling storytelling. The animation perfectly captures the emotional turmoil experienced by the characters as they navigate through increasingly bizarre and otherworldly environments. The story, while fantastical, expertly weaves in elements of human relationships and mental health, keeping viewers emotionally invested in the growth and development of the protagonist, Zan. The voice acting is top-notch, with the talented cast bringing depth and nuance to the eccentric and complex characters. The score - highlighted by the epic and haunting \"Rhapsody in Blue\" composition - is the cherry on top of an already immersive and captivating experience. The show is not without its flaws, of course. Some may argue the pacing can be slow at times, but I argue that this allows for moments of introspection and character development that add weight to the series as a whole. And while a few episodes veer into territory that may challenge the viewer's suspension of disbelief, the overall impact of the show remains remarkably grounded and engaging. The \"Rhapsody in Blue\" episode serves as a perfect introduction to a series that delves deep into the psyche of its lead character, yet maintains a sense of wonder and discovery that pulls the viewer deeper into its fascinating world. This is a series that is certainly not to be missed by both fans of exceptional animation and gripping character-driven storytelling. I highly recommend giving it a watch, and you may find yourself as hooked on the series as I was from the very first scene.", "Person1: We're having a department meeting at 10 o'clock, ok?

To me history and truth mean a lot.This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book. Well it's not. The movie is about the novels 1950s version. Some actors were GREAT but that doesn't cover the plot.In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. The devil analogy persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. Though other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored.First we get the caveman story. The women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. Real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. Hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. All this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.Next we get Egypt's first pyramid construction. Today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. Loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid build.The part about Moses and one true god was as if the Spanish inquisition was asking nicely. Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.Helen of Troy's evil grim was so vile that I didn't see why so many were even interested in her. In reality they were just soldiers, following commanders orders, who were \"discussing\" a political issue of power. She was just an excuse.The Cleopatra story was were I saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. Here brother was a LOT younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was quite educated to restore library content, and was politically competitive to drag beaten down Egypt out of dirt.The part with Nero and praying Christians in a cave were disgusting. Yes, Rome burned down. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portray it was as if the Coliseum build itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome.Attila the Hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. A LOT of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming, hygiene and plagues.Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. Territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At here burning I wanted to yell \"Hura! Now die already! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?.\"By the time they mentioned Leonardo I already got fed up with the movie. Columbus, Spanish slaughter of America, yelling Queen Elisabeth \"kick the Spanish armada\" and so on and so on.The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Amusing, but no more than a smile.The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as plagues (after renascence). When they start portraying revolutions, things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. The US revolution was pursued by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger, you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title \"Emperor.\" The conquests in Europe, defeat in Russia are sacked to Waterloo.The US civil war, the English rich inventors (Tesla not included). \"Mister Watson, come here, I want you\" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. Adolph's words \"I invade Russia. This is my last territorial demand\" were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial demand.To build suspense God puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the \"wall\" for the final words. All mighty cant pause the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man, because the bomb was to go of today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now that is so wrong Pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. And making music out of a weapon? Deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster.The way I see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. And honestly, compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.To summarize all I will just quote \"Firefly\"s episode \"Jaynestown\": \"It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. Ain't about you, Jayne. It's about what they need.\"", "Color Doppler imaging can be used to assess ocular blood flow velocities, and studies have shown that there can be reduced blood flow velocities in patients with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration. For instance, a study by Ciulla et al. in 1999 found that patients with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration had reduced blood flow velocities in the choroidal circulation when compared to age-matched controls. Another study by Cevik et al. in 2005 also reported that patients with nonexudative age-related macular degeneration had significantly lower blood flow velocities in the retrobulbar arteries. However, the relationship between reduced ocular blood flow velocities and the development or progression of nonexudative age-related macular degeneration is still unclear, and more research is needed to fully understand the role of ocular blood flow in this condition.", "If diffusion is very rapid, the system is well-mixed. The transition to life becomes increasingly difficult as the lattice size is increased because the concentration fluctuations that drive the transition become relatively smaller when larger numbers of molecules are involved. In contrast, when diffusion occurs at a finite rate, concentration fluctuations are local. The transition to life occurs in one local region and then spreads across the rest of the surface. The transition becomes easier with larger lattice sizes because there are more independent regions in which it could occur. The key observations that apply to our models and to the real world are that the origin of life is a rare stochastic event that is localized in one region of space due to the limited rate of diffusion of the molecules involved and that the subsequent spread across the surface is deterministic. It is likely that the time required for the deterministic spread is much shorter than the waiting time for the origin, in which case life evolves only once on a planet, and then rapidly occupies the whole surface.", "I really like the movie's opening, when Col. Ted Masters realizes on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 o'clock. The adrenaline-pumping score and fast-paced editing work perfectly to create a sense of urgency and danger as Masters and his wingman try to outmaneuver and engage the enemy jets. Director John Doe does an excellent job of putting the audience right in the cockpit with Masters, utilizing impressive aerial photography and seamless special effects. The first dogfight sequence is meticulously choreographed and beautifully shot, which makes it all the more intense and heart-pounding to watch. The movie's focus on character development is another aspect that sets it apart from other action-packed fighter jet films. The camaraderie and competition between Masters and the other pilots feel authentic, while the bond he forms with his young protege, Lt. Jane Smith, adds depth and emotional weight to the story. The character portrayals by the lead actors are captivating and believable, and their on-screen chemistry only adds to the film's overall appeal. The high-octane action and engaging storyline keep the audience captivated, while the quieter moments on the ground allow them to catch their breath and invest in the characters. The movie also offers a look at the inner workings of a fighter squadron, which adds another layer of interest and authenticity. The climax of the film, with Masters and his squadron going on a high-stakes mission, is both thrilling and emotionally resonant. The combination of stunning aerial visuals, an edge-of-your-seat-plot, and the audience's investment in the characters make for a truly exhilarating experience. Overall, the movie offers an exciting blend of action, drama, and character-driven storytelling that makes it a must-see for fans of the genre. With its impressive cinematography, strong performances, and intricate storytelling, this film is not only an action-packed thrill ride but also a heart-warming and inspirational journey of camaraderie, sacrifice, and heroism.", "This question seems to be asking about the effects of long-term statin administration on cell-mediated immunity in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia who are being treated with effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). It also mentions a two-year prospective study comparing statin and fibrate administration. To answer this question, we would need to look into the specific study mentioned to see if such a study has been conducted and published. However, I'm unable to find the specific study you're referring to. There have been some studies suggesting that statins may have immunomodulatory effects in people with HIV, but the results are mixed and the overall impact on cell-mediated immunity not fully understood. Some research suggests that statins may have beneficial effects on inflammation and immune activation in people with HIV. However, other studies have not observed significant impacts on immune function. Further research is required to determine whether prolonged statin administration can effectively modulate immune function in HIV-infected patients. In summary, the data are inconclusive and further research is needed to confirm the effects of prolonged statin administration versus fibrate administration on the cell-mediated immunity of HIV-infected, dyslipidemic patients receiving effective HAART.", "Per Mertesacker Speaks on the Improved Performance of Arsenal after Embarrassing Defeats Recently, Arsenal's centre-back Per Mertesacker spoke about how the team's embarrassing defeats in heavy games motivated the players to bring back the 'arguing culture' to improve their performance.

That's what happened to cyclist Wang Pingan as he neared the end of a two-wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country, according to local media. Arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, in southern Guandong province, Wang locked up his trusty mountain bike, loaded with panniers, to check out electronics markets in the city's Huaqiangbei area. Within 10 minutes the thieves struck. But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. Despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered, Shenzhen's finest managed to track it down and return it. The Southern Metro News reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent Wang a photo of a bike they recovered. He recognized it instantly. They said the theft, from a road junction \"infested\" by cycle thieves was caught on surveillance cameras. The bike had likely been sold twice before being recovered. \"We don't want this lad visiting Shenzhen and having a bad memory of the city,\" a police spokesman told the paper. Now, with 29,200 kilometers under his tires, Wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey. He'll be able to add his final destination, Hainan Island, to a route that has already taken in some of the country's most far-flung places. Among them are Mohe in Heilongjiang, China's northernmost and coldest place, Urumqi in the west and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the southwest.. Wang, a recent university graduate, who embarked on his trip with a budget of little more than 100, had earlier turned down offers from across China to help him get a new bike, vowing to walk if he couldn't be reunited with his \"old lover.\" \"It has a special meaning to me,\" he said, according to SMN. Before the bike's recovery, Wang had posted a heart-rending tribute to his bike on social media, recalling their adventures together. \"The bicycle itself doesn't have a high value, but spending more than a year with it, it's like a best friend who has accompanied me on my way, and taken me to every place without complaints,\" he writes. \"Thank you, my buddy, maybe I'll never see you again ... I remember I cried during the difficult times at the beginning of the trip and you were by my side.\" CNN's Shen Lu, Maggie Hiufu Wong and Barry Neild contributed to this story .", "Person1: Tom, as the manager of a company selling green products, you are now quite a successful businessman.

Person1: By the way, what aspects of your life are green? Person2: I'm only mildly green. I do simple things and I'm a huge biker. I biked cross Canada. Person1: Do you think you have ever done anything wasteful? Person2: We're always doing something wrong, but then, that will allow us to learn and grow. When I first started out, we made all the products ourselves, but that was a mistake. Now we work with other companies. We provide the materials, the product development and the design. They make the products then.", "The omens are looking good. After taking the big race on the opening day of the Grand National festival, AP McCoy repeated the trick on Don Cossack to the delight of a huge Ladies' day crowd. McCoy, who will ride hot favourite Shutthefrontdoor in the Crabbie's Grand National on Saturday, struck on day one in the Doom Bar Aintree Hurdle with Jezki. If the trend continues, McCoy will be celebrating another victory in the biggest race of all. And if he wanted a further sign that the cards are falling in his favour, the last time he won the Melling Chase - on Alberta's Run in 2010 - he followed up the next day in the Grand National on Don't Push It. AP McCoy celebrates after winning the Melling Chase race at Aintree on Friday . McCoy rode Don Cossack to victory as he prepares for his final Grand National on Saturday . There may have been some fortune attached to Jezki's victory as favourite Arctic Fire fell at the last flight when poised to challenge. Here, though, there was no luck involved. Don Cossack was mighty impressive in running away with The Grade One Betfred Melling Chase, prompting his trainer Gordon Elliot to talk of a challenge for the Cheltenham Gold Cup next year. This was one of the more straightforward successes in McCoy's career, as once he took up the running three fences from home the result was never in doubt.

In the end, there was a yawning 26-lengths back to second placed Cue Card, with John's Spirit back in third. Elliott, who won the Grand National in 2007 with Silver Birch, said: 'The horse is the apple of my eye. I was delighted to see him sent on when he was, as we know that he stays. It is nice having a winner for AP, as well. He is a genius. He has ridden a good few winners for me over the years.' This has been a memorable meeting for Elliott, who saddled a first day double with Clarcam and Tagliatelle. He saddles Cause of Causes in the big one and hopes are high of a bold show. 'When I won the National last time, I didn't really appreciate it, 'said Elliott. 'We are looking forward to tomorrow (Saturday).'", "Yes, H. pylori can interact with MHC class II molecules on gastric epithelial cells, which contributes to the dynamic gastric epithelial apoptotic response. H. pylori is a bacterium known to cause chronic gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer. It has been shown that H. pylori can actively manipulate the host immune system, and one such mechanism is through MHC class II molecules. MHC class II molecules are important for antigen presentation and activation of CD4 T cells in the immune system. H. pylori can increase the expression of MHC class II molecules on gastric epithelial cells and interact with them, leading to the activation of host autoreactive T cells. The activated T cells can then release cytokines that contribute to tissue damage, inflammation, and altered gastric epithelial cell turnover. This can ultimately result in the induction of apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells and contribute to the development and progression of gastric diseases associated with H. pylori infection.", "As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. I was caught between suffocating boredom and the occasional gasp for air provided by its few redeeming moments. The plot was a tangled mess, leaving me to wonder if the screenwriters had any semblance of direction or purpose. Even the film's star-studded cast couldn't save this sinking ship, as their performances seemed to be as stifled as my own breathing. Visually, the film was a hodgepodge of muted colors and uninspired cinematography, which only served to compound my sense of frustration with the entire experience. I struggled to find even a single shot that managed to elicit any sort of emotion within me. The film's soundtrack was equally forgettable, amounting to little more than background noise that barely registered in my consciousness. As I left the theater, I couldn't help but be relieved that the plastic bag of this film had finally released its grasp on me. In the end, I wouldn't recommend subjecting yourself to this suffocating cinematic disaster - unless, of course, you're in desperate need of a nap.", "That is what this movie is - a rollercoaster ride of emotions, thrilling action, and mind-bending plot twists. From the very beginning, the audience is hooked and drawn into a world of intrigue, leaving them constantly guessing what comes next. The characters are well developed, and their actions and decisions throughout the movie make for a complex and engaging story. The cinematography and visual effects are top-notch, creating a vast and immersive universe that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The soundtrack complements the visuals perfectly, heightening the experience, and adding depth to the atmosphere. Moreover, the movie touches on important themes, such as friendship, sacrifice, and the power of hope in the face of adversity. These themes are woven into the narrative gracefully, leaving a long-lasting impression after the end credits roll. The cast delivers phenomenal performances, making the characters feel genuine and relatable. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, making the bonds they forge throughout their journey believable and heartwarming.

It will leave you with a whirlwind of emotions and a newfound appreciation for the strength of the human spirit.", "To study this immunoregulatory effect more directly, we induced acute GVH reactions in which we treated the donors rather than the recipients with palifermin. The recipient mice were protected from GVHD-associated morbidity, and their cytokine profile was predominantly Th2. The palifermin-treated donor mice alone showed a similar Th2 cytokine profile, and we observed elevated levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin mRNA in the thymus. We further demonstrated that treating the donor mice with palifermin protects against GVHD-associated morbidity, even if the donors are deficient in Valpha14i natural killer T cells. Our findings clearly show that palifermin mediates immunoregulatory effects in addition to its cytoprotective effects and that both are likely to be involved in the mechanism through which palifermin provides protection from acute murine GVHD.", "AR (in vivo) does not reflect cast geometry, probably because of (1) underestimation by AR because of methodological problems caused by the cavity geometry, (2) deformation of compliant structures within the nasal passageways resulting from the casting procedure, andor (3) the casting material reaches parts of the nasal cavity not accessible to sound, e.g., sinuses or recesses. Nevertheless, this study does not preclude the use of AR as a sensitive method suited to evaluate relative changes in nasal volume caused by experimental challenges of the nasal mucosa. Compared with AR (in vivo), casts still may be of use but it is less sensitive to measure relative changes after experimental challenge.", "Cambridge University considers introducing entrance exams for applicants Cambridge University, one of the world's top institutions, is considering introducing entrance exams to help select the best and brightest applicants. The prestigious university explains that changes in A-level examination criteria have made it difficult to choose the most qualified and deserving pupils. These proposed entrance exams, which are expected to be introduced next year, will enable the university to streamline the selection process for undergraduate applicants. In recent years, A-level results have shown a downward trend in top grades, with fewer than 9 of pupils achieving the highest results this year, compared to 9.3 in the previous year. Furthermore, the structure of A-level exams is being altered, with coursework and assessment components being reintroduced after a shift towards traditional exams. Cambridge University is not alone in facing the challenge of assessing the aptitude of candidates for its competitive courses. Many universities, particularly those who are part of the Russell Group, have commented on the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between students with similar exam results. Given the recent changes to exam structure and the lack of consistency in A-Level subject choice within secondary education, selecting the best suited applicants has become a challenge for top educational institutions. The reintroduction of entrance exams would be one solution to this problem. It is important to note that Cambridge University used to require applicants to sit an entrance exam regardless of their subject choice but phased these tests out in the 1980s. This practice was, however, retained for international students and is still component of the admissions process for these applicants. These new Cambridge entrance exams are being developed by Cambridge Assessment, one of the UK's leading exam boards. Each subject area will have its own entrance test according to the demands of the course. The exams will consist of written papers, essays, problem-solving exercises, and multiple choice questions. Those who pass the entrance exams will then be invited for an interview before being offered a place at the prestigious university.", "Yesterday, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Hillary Clinton's signature black customized van, nicknamed \"Scooby,\" was parked in a spot reserved for the disabled just outside a cafe. Clinton met with Democratic Party insiders inside the cafe for 90 minutes, where the former US president and first lady reportedly discussed sensitive matters. The meeting was so important, the insiders were asked to hand over their cameras and cell phones. The van completed Iowa's famous \"River to River Road\" in 2014, with Bill Clinton behind the wheel. The Clinton Foundation spent USD 10,000 to outfit the van for a three-day trip that included stops in Des Moines, Elkhart, and Indianola. The foundation's investment allowed her to park it on a nice blue handicap sign at the cafe. Although Clinton walked right past an unmistakable blue parking sign to climb into the van, as the Secret Service are technically federal law-enforcement officers and the vehicle is never left unattended, there was no chance of her receiving a parking ticket.", "A zoo in Ohio is celebrating the 'miracle' birth of three rare Amur tiger cubs after it was feared their mother's biological clock had stopped ticking.

Open wide: A zoo in Ohio is celebrating the 'miracle' birth of three rare Amur tiger cubs after it was feared their mother's biological clock had stopped ticking . Bundle of joy: Keepers at the Columbus Zoo say ten-year-old Irisa had bred before but never conceived - however, this spring it was found the female cat was pregnant - with triplets . 'We are always cautiously optimistic about the survival of fragile newborns,' said Columbus Zoo president Tom Stalf. 'But the cubs seem to be thriving under the 24-hour care provided by our animal specialists and veterinarians.' Video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping. The baby cats currently weigh a healthy 2.5lbs but they're set to grow to a heftier 650lbs. Their eyes are also closed but should open over the coming days. In safe hands: While the birth on Tuesday morning went smoothly, Irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are currently being hand-reared in an incubator . Taking it easy: Video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping . It is unknown when they will go on display to the public and how keepers will go about naming them. These are the first cubs for ten-year-old female, Irisa, although the Zoo team and the Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) had hoped for years she would reproduce and pass on her valuable genes. This is the third litter sired by 11-year-old, Foli, since 2012. Gestation for tigers is about three-and-a-half months which means the cubs were conceived just weeks before Foli left for another facility in Kansas on February 25. He has been retired from breeding. Tiny tots: They currently weigh 2.5lbs but are set to grow to a heftier 650lbs . Growing pains: Their eyes are also closed but should open over the coming days .

Jupiter was born at the Moscow Zoo in 2007 and came to the Columbus Zoo from the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic. Both males were moved at the recommendation of the Species Survival Plan in an effort to maintain a sustainable population of tigers in human care. With the addition of the three cubs there are currently ten Amur tigers at the Columbus Zoo including four cubs born in 2013 and their mother, Mara.", "Christine Carriage, 67, (pictured) was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Norwich Crown Court . A grandmother hoarded 1,300 items of stolen clothing in her tiny bungalow - which police said was like a 'warehouse'. Officers raiding Christine Carriage's one-bedroom home found that 340 of the stolen items still had price tags on. But this week the 67-year-old walked free from court. A total of 1,337 items of clothing, shoes and handbags - valued at 5,620 - were seized by police from the home in Bowthorpe, Norwich, on November 4, 2013. William Carter, prosecuting, said police found an 8ft-long clothes rail bending under the huge weight of the clothing in one room. He said: 'The officers described the property as looking more like a clothing warehouse than a dwelling. Each room was packed.' On Wednesday, Carriage admitted acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. When police searched the house, she was at the property with son Shane Carriage, 45, and grandson Luke Hall. Officers found cash, drug paraphernalia and at least an eighth of a kilo of cocaine. Carriage had convictions for dishonesty from the 1960s and 1970s, and two convictions for shoplifting in the 1980s, as well as one in 1996 and another in 2012. Philippa Page, defending, said some items were Carriage's clothes and those of her son, grandson and late husband. She said Carriage was guilty of mistaken family loyalty in allowing her 'increasingly out-of-control' grandson to store stolen clothes at her home. Sentencing Carriage, Judge Maureen Bacon told her: 'You have been a dishonest woman through all your life. 'I don't see why I should inflict your keep on the public purse by sending you to prison today.' She was given a suspended six-month jail sentence, ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work and told to pay an 80 victim surcharge at Norwich Crown Court. But Carriage and her son were cleared of supplying cocaine last August after Recorder Peter Wallis ruled there was no case to answer. Hall had previously admitted supplying cocaine, possessing cocaine and possessing criminal property and was jailed for 34 months.

A French man moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is unbelievably bland. The only bright spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. But bare armpits does not a good movie make. L'Emmerdeur was funny, so was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with French comedy.", "In 1968 when, \"SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One,\" was released, it came from out of nowhere, and struck like a psychedelic thunderbolt. Director William Greaves dared to create a film that challenged social norms and conventional filmmaking, by blurring the lines between fiction and reality while delving into the inner workings of the human psyche. The premise of the film is simple yet wildly inventive - a documentary crew films a director while he tries to shoot a narrative film that is ultimately scrapped, creating a meta-film within a film. As the cameras roll, the cast and crew are forced to confront their own creative and personal struggles, ranging from relationship troubles to doubts about their roles in the production. This chaos and confusion gives birth to a strangely compelling and hypnotic experience. The loosely improvised performances of the actors add a certain charm to the film. They deliver rawness and vulnerability, which constantly keeps the viewer on their toes, questioning if they are stepping into the realm of unscripted reality or simply remaining within a tightly structured artistic vision. As a result, \"SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One\" takes on a life of its own, transcending the boundaries of conventional cinema and evolving into an immersive and cathartic experience. The cinematography is equally impressive and groundbreaking, capturing the beautiful chaos and disorder of a tumultuous production both in and out of the frames. The multiple cameras used by Greaves break the walls of what would be deemed as \"acceptable\" in traditional filmmaking. The film's hallucinatory visuals and disorienting cuts add to the overall trippy and surreal experience. One cannot discuss \"SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One\" without addressing the film's daring attempt to capture deeper philosophical questions about the nature of truth, art, and humanity. By allowing the characters to ponder about their own existence and purpose, the film forces the viewer to confront their own reality and perhaps even question the very nature of cinema itself. In conclusion, \"SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One\" remains a fascinating and captivating cinematic masterpiece, a true attack on the senses and a testament to the boundless potential of the medium. It is a shining example of experimental filmmaking that challenges both form and content, and stands tall as a timeless work of art. If you're looking for a thought-provoking and otherworldly experience, this gem from 1968 is certainly worth a watch.", "Thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activation has been shown to play a role in various processes in the central nervous system, including maintaining the blood-brain barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting neuroprotection. However, the direct involvement of thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activation in mitochondrial function and myelination has not been extensively studied or clearly established. Some research has suggested that activated protein C (APC) may help promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Oligodendrocytes are the cells responsible for myelinating axons in the central nervous system. Additionally, APC has been shown to have anti-apoptotic effects in various cell types, which might indirectly support mitochondrial function and overall cell health. However, more research is needed to determine the specific roles and mechanistic pathways through which thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activation may affect mitochondrial function and myelination in the central nervous system.", "When John Carpenter's masterly version of \"The Thing\" was released in summer 1982, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office. However, as the years have passed, this sci-fi horror thriller has achieved cult status and is now considered a groundbreaking classic in both its genre and filmmaking as a whole. Set in Antarctica, \"The Thing\" tells the story of a group of researchers who encounter a mysterious and deadly creature that assimilates and replicates other organisms. Kurt Russell delivers a standout performance as helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady, the somewhat reluctant yet determined leader of the group as they fight to survive against an extraterrestrial enemy that could be any one of them. The special effects in \"The Thing\" are truly a sight to behold, with Rob Bottin's practical creature designs both grotesque and mesmerizing. The innovative use of animatronics and puppetry creates a surreal, tangible horror, which many argue has yet to be replicated despite advances in CGI. Carpenter's direction is nothing short of masterful, ratcheting up the tension as the film progresses, intensifying the feeling of paranoia and mistrust among the characters. This is further complemented by the haunting, minimalist score by Ennio Morricone, which adds a depth of unease and terror to the movie. \"The Thing\" is also notable for its themes of isolation and the question of what it truly means to be human, all wrapped up in a gut-wrenching, suspenseful narrative that is both timeless and unforgettable. The film brilliantly balances the horrors of its monsters with the complexities of human relationships, making the viewer question who, or what, is the true enemy. In conclusion, \"The Thing\" is not only a classic sci-fi horror film, but is also a shining example of outstanding filmmaking. While it may not have initially been well-received by critics or financially successful upon its release, time has shown that it is indeed a groundbreaking and influential piece of cinema. With exceptional direction, an iconic story, and captivating visual effects, John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" deserves all the adoration it has since garnered, and it remains a compelling and visceral experience to this day.", "Person1: Oh, come on!

Person2: It's not that, I just don't feel like I have anything to say. What would I even start a conversation about? Person1: It's not that hard. You can find common ground in so many things - like asking about her favorite music or movies, her thoughts on the event, or what she does for fun. Be confident, and just be yourself. Person2: I guess you're right. Maybe I've just been overthinking things. Should I just walk up to her and ask her to dance? Person1: Sure, but it might be nice to break the ice with a bit of conversation first. Just be natural and show genuine interest in getting to know her. Person2: Alright, I will give it a shot.

Person2: Alright, here goes nothing!", "This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award. Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. Later episodes in the series (of which there were four in total) were not actually based on original Dr Seuss material, although all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style. The three sequels were: Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); How Now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr Magoo.", "Blackpool, UK - Controversial striker Nile Ranger has been absent without leave (AWOL) from Blackpool Football Club since early December. Fans and club management alike are growing increasingly concerned about the mysterious disappearance of the former Newcastle forward who last played for the Seasiders at the end of November. It's not the first time that Ranger has been involved in off-field issues. In 2013, he was arrested for assault and later in 2014, he faced a rape charge which was eventually dropped. The 28-year-old forward's contract with the League One team is set to expire at the end of this season, adding to the club's growing list of impending departures. Ranger, who originated from London, began his football career with Southampton before moving on to play for the likes of Newcastle United, Barnsley, and Swindon Town. After several loan spells, he joined Blackpool in 2017 and made a promising start, scoring his first goal for the club in a 3-1 win over Charlton Athletic. However, his career at Blackpool took a turn for the worse when he found himself on the wrong side of the club's management. Ranger accused Blackpool officials of mocking him and undermining his efforts to contribute to the team's performance on the field. Despite the player's claims, Blackpool has made it clear that they've always been supportive of Ranger. Club officials have been quoted as saying, \"We gave Nile and his two representatives full access to our club's facilities and have worked closely with him to rehabilitate his troubled past.\" While there are no indications of Ranger's potential next move, his actions have left Blackpool in a difficult position. With upcoming crucial matches in the coming months, the team must now find a way to make up for the missing leadership and firepower of their AWOL forward. As Nile Ranger's departure from Blackpool seems imminent with the expiration of his contract, fans and authorities are left to wonder what could have been, had he been able to overcome the obstacles that have plagued his intriguing football career.", "L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis, which is saying something, as the latter show aired six decades ago. While this French-Spanish co-production set in a lively European panorama and boasting a talented ensemble cast promises much, it ultimately falls short due to weak plot and characters whose emotional struggles don't quite resonate. The basic premise - a group of international students sharing an apartment in Barcelona - provides ample scope for a range of amusing escapades and cross-cultural camaraderie. However, it doesn't quite fulfill its potential. Xenophobic stereotypes are abundant and stale, and the comedic timing misses its mark, leaving viewers waiting for the punchline. Romain Duris shows promise in the lead role, but the lackluster script limits his ability to develop any depth to his character. He is surrounded by a diverse array of housemates, but unfortunately, they fare little better, with most existing only to perpetuate drawn-out, contrived storylines. The film's saving grace lies in capturing the beauty of Barcelona - from picture-perfect Gaudi architectural wonders to the vivid nightlife scene. The city's energy and vibrancy leap out from the screen, providing a stunning visual backdrop that outshines the narrative itself. In short, L'Auberge Espagnole had the potential to be a hilarious and insightful exploration of life as an Erasmus student facing culture shock, identity crises, and complex relationships. Instead, it disappoints with a combination of predictable gags, flat characters, and squandered opportunities. If only it possessed the charm and wit of Dobie Gillis, this film could have left a more agreeable and lasting impression.", "STAR RATING: Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning Title: Treading Thin Blue Lines In \"Treading Thin Blue Lines,\" unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) flits away his time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel. This charming and comedic romp through a small town's police force delivers both thrilling action and tender moments. Vinnie Jones brings a charismatic, rough-around-the-edges charm to the role, making Sullivan's exploits all the more enjoyable. His entanglements with the local cops provide ample laugh-out-loud moments, and the stunt work brings an element of excitement to the proceedings. The romantic subplot between Sullivan and the police officer, played with equal parts sass and vulnerability by Hayley Atwell, helps to humanize both characters and provides a heartwarming anchor for the film. Their chemistry is magnetic and adds depth to the story. The supporting cast of oddball police officers is a consistent source of humor and surprises, with standout performances by Stanley Tucci and Rebel Wilson. Meanwhile, some well-timed cameos and references to similar movies elevate \"Treading Thin Blue Lines\" above the typical cop comedy fare. The result is a film that feels fresh yet familiar, and always entertaining. Although the climax may be a bit predictable, the journey getting there is filled with such fun twists and turns that it hardly matters. Overall, \"Treading Thin Blue Lines\" is perfect for a Friday night movie that delivers laughs, thrills, and a touch of romance.", "An in vivo reporter of BMP signaling in organogenesis can potentially reveal targets in the developing kidney. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are important regulators of organ development, including kidney organogenesis. By using an in vivo reporter system, researchers can monitor and visualize the localization and timing of BMP signaling during kidney development. This may help in identifying specific cells and structures that are targeted by BMP signaling, which in turn can contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying kidney development and the ways in which BMP signaling regulates this process. However, it is important to note that the results will depend on the specific reporter system used and the experimental design, as well as the developmental stage of the kidney being studied. Overall, though, an in vivo reporter of BMP signaling can potentially provide valuable insights into the role of BMP signaling in kidney organogenesis and reveal target structures within the developing kidney.", "Person1: Right.

Meanwhile, Bristol City is on course to win the League One title with a victory against Coventry City. The stakes are high in football circles this weekend as clubs across the country prepare to fight for promotion or battle to avoid relegation. Among those with everything to play for is Wigan, who currently sits precariously in the relegation zone, with only goal difference separating them from safety. A win against Brighton could stave off relegation, at least for a while, but Wigan will need to pull out all the stops in their remaining fixtures to secure their Championship survival. However, nothing less than three points will do, with a draw or a loss confirming their relegation to League One. On the other hand, Bristol City has been enjoying a spectacular season and currently sits atop League One, with a healthy lead over second-place Preston North End. A win against Coventry City this weekend will be enough to guarantee their promotion as League One champions. However, the race for promotion is still wide open, with several clubs within striking distance. Should Bristol City fail to secure all three points this weekend, it could open the door for the likes of Preston North End, Swindon Town, and Milton Keynes Dons to make a late push for the title. All eyes will be on these crucial fixtures this weekend, as the season reaches its climax. Fans and players alike will undoubtedly be on the edge of their seats, as the dreams of promotion are fulfilled for some and the nightmares of relegation become a reality for others.

Set in New York during the late 19th century, \"The Gilded Age\" will tell the story of the immensely wealthy and the social climbers who flocked to the city in the pursuit of the American dream. With a similar vein as Downton Abbey, the show will focus on the lives of both the elite and their less privileged counterparts, whose relationships with one another create a complex tapestry of American history and society. As both Downton Abbey and The Gilded Age are conceived and penned by writer and creator Julian Fellowes, fans are cautiously optimistic about the potential inclusion of Dame Maggie Smith's character, the indomitable Dowager Countess Violet Crawley. Smith's performance on Downton Abbey captivated audiences and critics alike, earning her numerous accolades and awards throughout the show's six-season run. In addition to the possible appearance of the Dowager Countess, there may also be a plot for American-born Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham, played by Elizabeth McGovern, allowing for more connections between the worlds of Downton Abbey and The Gilded Age. Fans have long speculated about the possibility of an American based Downton spin-off, and the inclusion of these characters in Fellowes' newest project would open the door to even more possibilities. The Gilded Age is set to premiere on [airdate] and will feature an all-star cast including Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, and Amanda Peet. With the potential appearances of these iconic characters from Fellowes' previous work, the stage is set for a new period drama to captivate both American and international audiences alike.

Guardiola believes the team is shackled by the absence of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola is concerned about his team without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery . Ribery (left) is absent with an ankle injury while Robben is out until May with a stomach muscle tear . 'Without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, we are a different team,' Guardiola said after the game. 'Of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one-on-one situations. We have other players and have to adapt the game for them.' Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of March. Ribery has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of Munich's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto. Munich's players celebrate after progressing to the semi-final of the German Cup . Thiago scored the winning penalty for Munich against Bayer Leverkusen as the shoot-out was won 5-3 . Guardiola will hope he can inspire his players to overcome the problem when they host Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday in the Bundesliga, looking to maintain their 10-point advantage over Wolfsburg. The one goal Munich did score over their last three encounters came from Robert Lewandowski in the 1-0 win against his former club Borussia Dortmund and the two sides will meet again in the semi-final.", "Yes, elevated activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is associated with enhanced liver injury following an alcohol binge in chronically ethanol-fed rats. Studies have shown that binge alcohol consumption in rats that are chronically fed ethanol leads to increased activation of ERK12 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2). This increased activation is linked to heightened inflammation and liver injury, which may contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease.", "Based on the ability of an amino-terminal fragment of the beta1 subunit to inhibit activity of an heterodimer consisting only of the catalytic domains (alphacatbetacat), Winger and Marletta (Biochemistry 2005, 44:4083-90) have proposed a direct interaction of the amino-terminal region of beta1 with the catalytic domains. In support of such a concept of \"trans\" regulation of sGC activity by the H-NOX domains our results indicate that the domains within sGC are organized in a way that allows for direct interaction of the amino-terminal regulatory domains with the carboxy-terminal catalytic region. In addition, we constructed \"fluorescent-conjoined\" sGC's by fusion of the alpha amino-terminus to the beta1 carboxy-terminus leading to a monomeric, fluorescent and functional enzyme complex. To our knowledge this represents the first example where a fluorescent protein links two different subunits of a higher ordered complex to yield a stoichometrically fixed functionally active monomer.", "Person1: Did you not sleep well last night?

Vacuum frying involves frying food products at a reduced pressure and lower temperature than conventional frying, which helps in preserving the natural color, flavor, and nutrients of the food. This frying technique reduces the oil absorption by the food products, thus yielding healthier snacks with lower fat content. Additionally, vacuum frying can minimize the formation of harmful compounds, such as acrylamide, that may form during high-temperature frying processes. Therefore, vacuum frying aligns with the growing demand for healthier, tastier, and more nutritious snack options.", "Fluorescent fusion proteins of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) have been used to study the structure and dynamics of the enzyme, which is a key receptor for nitric oxide (NO) and plays a central role in NO signaling. sGC is composed of two subunits, each of which possesses a heme nitric oxide sensing domain (H-NOX) and a catalytic domain. The use of fluorescent fusion proteins allows researchers to monitor conformational changes in sGC upon binding of NO to the H-NOX domain. Studies with these fusion proteins have revealed that the proximity of the H-NOX domain and the catalytic domain changes upon NO binding. These conformational changes are believed to play a role in how sGC is activated and catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP. So, fluorescent fusion proteins of soluble guanylyl cyclase can provide information about the spatial relationship between the heme nitric oxide domain and the catalytic domain, and how they change upon NO binding, which may help us understand the underlying mechanisms of sGC activation in response to nitric oxide signaling.", "\"Game of Thrones\" Hit by Devastating Leak In a shocking turn of events, fans worldwide found the next four \"Game of Thrones\" episodes released on Saturday night, four weeks ahead of schedule, on several piracy websites. The hugely popular HBO series has long been known as one of the most pirated shows in the world. However, what makes this leak particularly devastating is that it is believed to have originated from press review copies. HBO released a statement expressing their awareness of the unauthorized leak and their intent to take the matter seriously. \"Sadly, it seems the leaked four episodes of the upcoming season of 'Game of Thrones' originated from within a group approved by HBO. We take this breach very seriously and have already initiated forensic investigations at our end to quickly determine the cause. This is a damaging and distressing breach for our network and for the show.\" According to anti-piracy analysts, Brazil stands out as the worst offender in terms of pirating content from \"Game of Thrones.\" In 2015, the country accounted for a shocking 29.77 million illegal downloads of the show. The United States and France followed behind Brazil, each contributing around 10 million downloads. As the wait for the last season of the popular show reaches fever pitch, this devastating leak raises vital questions about the effectiveness of the show creators' anti-piracy efforts. The source of the leak highlights the need for tighter security and stricter protocols in sharing review copies with press and perhaps reconsidering the extent of early access provided to press and other insiders. With HBO reeling from this breach of trust, it remains to be seen how much of a negative impact this leak will have on the highly-anticipated final season of the show. Many loyal fans have taken to social media to denounce those who have watched the leaked episodes, vowing to wait until the official release to watch the series in support of the creators. Whether the network will choose to alter its protocol for distributing sensitive material to prevent future leaks is yet to be seen, but one thing is for sure: \"Game of Thrones\" continues to reign supreme in popularity and piracy.", "Person1: Of course you can be interested, but it just seemed like a lot of questions.

I was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. But a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? I know... I know. Then they go into several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we get into a story with Isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.I mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. Not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film, which I didn't like at all because I couldn't take it seriously.

The incident occurred when a bullet, originally aimed at an aggressive dog, missed its target and struck the young boy instead. Danel was playing outside when the unidentified shooter tried to subdue the aggressive dog in their neighborhood. The bullet narrowly missed the boy's liver but left him with serious injuries. Doctors and medical staff at the hospital have been working tirelessly to ensure that Danel recovers fully from the incident. The police have launched an investigation into the events leading up to the shooting, and are working to identify the person responsible for this tragic accident. Officers are currently reviewing surveillance footage from nearby homes and interviewing witnesses to establish a clearer account of what transpired. While the full extent of Danel's injuries and prognosis are yet to be determined, his family has expressed their gratitude for the overwhelming support they have received from friends, neighbors, and residents of their quiet community. The concerned residents have been rallying around Danel and his family, offering their help and assistance in any way they can. Local businesses and community members have also been donating funds to assist the family with any unforeseen medical expenses that may arise as a result of the accident. This tragic shooting has brought the issue of stray bullet incidents and the dangers of using firearms irresponsibly back into the spotlight. Authorities have urged residents to practice responsible firearm use and educate themselves on proper safety precautions.

However, I can provide you with some general information on the topic: D90 is a dosimetric parameter that refers to the dose delivered to 90 of the target volume (e.g., the prostate gland) during brachytherapy, such as I-125 seed implant monotherapy for localized prostate cancer treatment. It is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in terms of dose distribution, and it is typically expressed in units of Grays (Gy). There have been studies conducted to investigate the correlation between D90 and treatment outcomes. Some findings suggest that higher D90 values are generally associated with better outcomes, such as lower rates of biochemical failure (e.g., an increase in prostate-specific antigen or PSA) and improved local control of the tumor. A higher D90 means that a larger percentage of the target volume has received an adequate dose of radiation, which is more likely to eradicate cancer cells. However, other factors such as patient age, tumor stage, Gleason score, and pre-treatment PSA levels also play a significant role in determining the prognosis and long-term outcomes for localized prostate cancer patients treated with I-125 seed implant monotherapy. In summary, while D90 can be an important dosimetry parameter for evaluating the efficacy of I-125 seed implant monotherapy in localized prostate cancer treatment, it should be considered along with various other clinical factors for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's prognosis and optimal treatment planning.", "You the living?

The 18-year-old, who was booked into Lower Buckeye Jail in Phoenix two weeks ago, is seen on surveillance video walking in a room he was not authorized to be in before being approached by two officers. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said that the two jail employees began telling the young man to go back to his cell before he began taking swings at them. Scroll down for video . An assault on an officer at a jail in Phoenix has left one officer in intensive care with brain bleeding. Above, the inmate is captured on video in a psychiatric ward area where he is not authorized . Officers including Scott Beaty (center) approached the unidentified 18-year-old inmate and told him to go back to his cell . The inmate then began punching Beatty and the other officer in the room, who used a Taser but could not subdue the young man . The unnamed inmate, who was not immediately affected by four taser shots, was eventually subdued by a large group of officers who came to the scene. Three detention officers were taken to a nearby hospital, and two of them had been knocked unconscious. Scott Beaty, a 15-year-veteran, was taken to the intensive care unit and will need reconstructive surgery after suffering a brain bleed and broken bones in his face. The inmate, who did not have any prior incidents of bad behavior, was not injured. After knocking Beaty to the ground, the inmate is seen attacking the other officer, who was also taken to a nearby hospital . More officers arrived on the scene where the assault took place, though additional taser shots did not immediately affect the 18-year-old . The unidentified inmate was eventually subdued by a group of officers, who saw their colleague knocked out on the ground after being hit repeatedly . 'Sometimes when you have a mental condition you fight and get super mad,' Arpaio said during a press conference, though he did not elaborate on the mental condition. Arpaio said he could not speculate on what led to the attack. The prisoner became 'very violent' according to officials, and was reportedly fighting until he was put in lock down in the psychiatric ward, where he remains. He will only be allowed out for one hour a day. Though he was booked into Lower Buckeye for a minor felony charge, the prisoner will now face aggravated assault charges. Arpaio said that there have been 178 incidents of assault at his county's jails in the last 12 months. Beaty was taken to the intensive care unit after the incident, where he suffered broken bones in his face and brain bleeding . Three of four officers injured in the attack went to the hospital.

Desmoglein 2 is a cadherin-type cell-cell adhesion protein primarily involved in cell adhesion and maintaining tissue integrity, while kallikrein 7 is a serine protease associated with various biological processes such as skin desquamation, inflammation, and cancer progression. Individual roles of desmoglein 2 and kallikrein 7 in pancreatic cancer have been investigated. Desmoglein 2 has been reported to be overexpressed in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer, and may be involved in cancer progression and invasion. Kallikrein 7, on the other hand, has been implicated in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the promotion of tumor invasion and metastasis in several cancers. However, current literature does not provide sufficient evidence that directly links desmoglein 2 as a substrate of kallikrein 7 in pancreatic cancer.

What time exactly? Person1: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30. Person2: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand? Person1: Yes, yes. Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end. Person2: Better to have buffet lunch? Person1: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday. Person2: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you needthat's basically the same as what you had last February. Person1: Oh, that'll be fine. Person2: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis. Person1: Free, fine, yes. Person2: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like? Person1: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working? Person2: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right? Person1: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure. Person2: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal. Person1: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before. Person2: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday? Person1: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations... Person2: 100?! Person1: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people. Person2: Yes, but the room won't... Person1: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.

The premise, which revolves around the accidental release of a gas that makes people laugh uncontrollably, held great potential for comedic moments. And with a star-studded comedic ensemble led by Steve Carell and Melissa McCarthy, I was ready for some major chuckles. However, the humor fell flat thanks primarily to a paper-thin plot and characters that appeared more like caricatures. The screenplay offered little substance, and the gags felt recycled from better comedies of the past. As the film stumbled from one slapstick scene to another, the actors tried valiantly to bring their best to the table, even in the face of paint-by-numbers material. Unfortunately, their talent couldn't compensate for the glaring weaknesses in the script, making their efforts feel tired and repetitive. The film's few redeeming qualities were some genuine belly laughs offered by the supporting cast, particularly Kate McKinnon and Ken Jeong. Their characters were quirkier and seemed to inject a much-needed spark that the rest of the film sorely lacked. But ultimately, their scenes couldn't save 'Laughing Gas' from its utter lack of comedic oomph. In conclusion, 'Laughing Gas' proved to be a disappointing entry into the comedy genre. Despite an amazing cast and an initial premise that could have made for a hilarious comedy, the weak screenplay and overused gags left viewers overwhelmingly unsatisfied. Save your time and money, and skip this gas of a comedy.", "Person1: Oh, I understand! How about a comedy instead? I heard there's a new one that just came out.

In this scenario, better understanding of host-parasite relationships is needed to elucidate the factors that determine intestinal helminth rejection. The intestinal trematode Echinostoma caproni has been broadly employed in this field, with resistance against secondary homologous infections reported in mice. In this paper, new insights are provided in the regulation of tissue homeostasis after intestinal infection. The unexpected lack of an altered pattern of ileal protein production associated to resistance development suggests that this resistance depends on rapid changes, affecting the early establishment of worms, rather than the activation of later effector mechanisms. These results may contribute to the development of new control tools for the management of these parasitic infections.", "Yes, large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium linkage analysis (LDLA) mapping studies can identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for boar taint and related sex steroids. Boar taint is an unpleasant odor and taste in pork, caused primarily by the presence of the compounds androstenone and skatole. Identifying QTLs associated with boar taint and sex steroids helps in understanding the genetic basis of these traits and can assist in breeding strategies to reduce boar taint in pork production. In recent years, several studies have used GWAS and LDLA mapping methods to identify QTLs associated with boar taint compounds and sex steroids in different pig breeds. These studies have identified significant QTLs on multiple chromosomes, which may explain the genetic variation in boar taint compounds and related sex steroids. These findings provide a basis for the development of marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection (GS) strategies to reduce the occurrence of boar taint in pig populations and improve pork quality. However, further research on the effects of the identified QTLs across different populations and breeds is necessary for the successful implementation of such strategies in pig breeding programs.", "Subheading: Cao Yu, 22-year-old, was on patrol when she confronted the man who wounded her five times In a shocking yet inspiring incident, a 22-year-old policewoman, Cao Yu, was stabbed by a robber while patrolling in northeastern China. Despite being injured, she showed immense bravery and held on to the man until reinforcements arrived. She has since become the symbol of courage and has been lauded by people all over the country. Cao Yu, the brave policewoman, was on night duty when she encountered the robber. She confronted the man bravely, without knowing that he was armed with a knife. The man viciously attacked her, stabbing her five times before she could call for help. Despite her grave injuries, she waited for backup without letting the robber escape. Upon their arrival, Cao Yu's colleagues found her \"bleeding all over\" but still holding on to the robber. She was rushed to the hospital where she received immediate medical assistance. Fortunately, her condition is stable and she is now recuperating from her injuries. The incident quickly garnered attention on social media, where people were in awe of Cao Yu's grit and determination. The young policewoman has become a heroic figure, receiving praise and support from all corners of the country.

Jan Jones had bought the bottle as a present, but her daughter luckily realized something was wrong after her first sip. After drinking just a mouthful of what was supposed to be wine, Jones' daughter began breaking out in painful welts. It was then the family decided to inspect the liquid and found it to be clear in color and smelling strongly of bleach. The wine was immediately discarded and Jones took to social media to share her shock and disappointment. Tesco responded to Jones' account of the incident on Twitter, stating that they were \"very concerned to hear of this\" and encouraged the family to return the bottle to their local store for investigation. The supermarket giant assured the public that the wine in question was not produced by Tesco, but by one of their suppliers. The company has since launched a full investigation into the matter. A Tesco spokesperson said, \"We were very concerned to hear of this incident and are in contact with the customer. We will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter.\" No other customers have reported similar experiences with the wine, and as of yet, there have been no recalls issued. Jan Jones' daughter is said to be recovering well after the unsettling incident, but the family is still seeking answers as to how bleach could have made its way into a seemingly harmless bottle of wine.", "Antigua, West Indies - England's premier fast bowler, James Anderson, stands on the brink of history as he prepares to earn his 100th Test cap on Monday, 28th January. As England faces the West Indies at the picturesque Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground, Anderson needs just four wickets to surpass Sir Ian Botham's national record of 383 Test wickets. More than fifteen years since he first represented the national team, the 36-year-old Anderson has been England's leading pace spearhead, playing an instrumental role in the team's rise to the top in Test cricket. Blessed with incredible swing, sly seam movement and relentless perseverance, the Lancashire pacer's mastery over the cricket ball has earned him rave reviews from teammates, coaches and opponents alike, who deem him one of the finest fast bowlers of his era. Born and bred in Burnley, Anderson started his cricketing journey with his hometown club, Lowerhouse Cricket Club and gradually made his way through the age-group ranks before joining the Lancashire County Cricket Club. His meteoric rise through the cricketing world saw him make his England debut against Zimbabwe in 2003, where he announced his arrival by picking up a crucial five-wicket haul. Since then, Anderson has been a stalwart for the English team, playing vital roles in several key victories in Tests, ODIs, and T20s. Among his innumerable accolades, he holds the record for the most Test five-wicket hauls for England with 27 to his name. Across his illustrious career, \"Jimmy,\" as he is fondly known, has picked up 380 wickets in Tests alone and has 269 scalps in ODIs. During this monumental Test match against the West Indies at Antigua, Anderson now has the chance to surpass the legendary Sir Ian Botham and make his mark as England's highest Test wicket-taker. Should Anderson make history and come out on top, he will surely be remembered as one of the greatest fast bowlers to ever play the game for his country.", "Rome (CNN) Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday alone SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea . CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.", "Predictable, gory, over-gimmicky, mediocre - these are the words that come to mind after watching \"Chainsaw Parade.\" The movie sets out to be yet another in a long line of slasher flicks, but ultimately fails to leave a mark. The film's plot has been seen time and time again - a group of attractive, clueless teenagers head to a secluded cabin for a weekend of drinking and debauchery, completely unaware of the crazed maniac lurking in the shadows. The film makes no attempt to subvert the genre or offer any original ideas, resulting in a wholly predictable and unsatisfying experience. As for the gore - there's plenty of it. Limbs are severed, innards spill, and blood sprays in a manner reminiscent of low-budget 1980s horror films. However, the overabundance of carnage feels cumbersome, senseless, and fails to elicit the fear or shock it was intended to stir. \"Chainsaw Parade\" relies heavily on gimmicks - not just in its special effects, but also in its reliance on a ridiculous villain straight out of a comic book. The chainsaw-wielding killer wears a garish, neon-colored outfit, and spouts cheesy one-liners after every successful slaughter. While campy humor can often elevate a horror movie, this attempt falls completely flat and renders the villain a laughable caricature rather than a threatening antagonist. The acting is mediocre across the board, and the characters are forgettable, one-dimensional, and ultimately uninteresting. It's impossible for the audience to care about their fates, and the typically suspenseful \"who will survive?\" question posed by many horror films is rendered moot. In conclusion, \"Chainsaw Parade\" is a tired rehash of worn-out tropes and excessive gore. Its over-the-top gimmicks and underdeveloped characters serve only to underscore the film's mediocrity. Though it may provide a small amount of entertainment for die-hard slasher fans, most viewers will find little to praise in this disappointing and derivative flick.", "It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of \"acting adult\" is not engaging in sensuality. In the charming and refreshingly wholesome movie \"Little Heroes,\" the audience is treated to a delightful display of friendship, adventure, and teamwork as a group of youngsters takes on a seemingly insurmountable challenge in their small town. The cast of talented young actors shines in their respective roles, each exhibiting a level of depth and nuance well beyond their years. The protagonists are relatable, and their camaraderie teaches valuable lessons about friendship and collaboration. It is worth mentioning that their dialogue and actions are age-appropriate, avoiding the pitfalls of making child characters seem precocious or worldly beyond their years. Director Jane Smith has crafted a visually stunning world, capturing the innocence of childhood and making the fictional town of Sunnyville come to life. The movie is peppered with comic relief, provided by the lovable yet bumbling town sheriff and the children's hilarious antics as they try to solve their town's mystery. \"Little Heroes\" leaves the audience feeling inspired, uplifted, and reminded of the importance of believing in oneself and the power of collaboration. In the midst of movies where child characters are often prematurely thrust into adulthood, \"Little Heroes\" is a breath of fresh air and a welcome addition to the family movie genre.", "Person1: Hi.

There are no well-conserved secreted polysaccharide-degrading enzymes present in all three Frankia genomes, suggesting that plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation may not be crucial to root infection, or that this degradation varies among strains. We hypothesize that the relative lack of secreted polysaccharide-degrading enzymes in Frankia reflects a strategy used by these bacteria to avoid eliciting host defense responses. The esterases, lipases, and proteases found in the core Frankia secretome might facilitate hyphal penetration through the cell wall, release carbon sources, or modify chemical signals. The core secretome also includes extracellular solute-binding proteins and Frankia-specific hypothetical proteins that may enable the actinorhizal symbiosis.", "This coming from an adult who happened to come across the first one expecting a movie aimed towards children and was surprised at the adult humor that was in Emperors New Groove, I must say, the sequel manages to capture the same charm and wit as the original. \"Kronk's New Groove\" perfectly balances the humor to entertain both children and adults alike. The story follows the lovable character Kronk, who gets a chance to step into the spotlight, showcasing all his endearing quirks and hilarious antics. The voice acting by Patrick Warburton as Kronk is stellar, as always, and the rest of the cast does an equally commendable job. The animation is bright and colorful, it retains the clean and attractive visual style of the first film. Though the plot may not be as strong as the original, the humor and character development make up for it. Watching our beloved characters from the first movie navigate through the adventures along with Kronk brings a sense of nostalgia that is undeniably heart-warming. While \"Kronk's New Groove\" may not quite reach the high benchmark set by \"The Emperor's New Groove,\" it remains a thoroughly enjoyable sequel that deserves recognition. It caters to an audience of both children and adults looking for a lighthearted and amusing movie experience.

Djokovic was a set down before he found his rhythm and secured a 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-0 win, remaining in contention for his fifth Miami Open title. Dolgopolov gained attention in the tennis world after defeating world No. 2 Rafael Nadal at the Indian Wells Masters earlier this month, and he proved to be a tough competitor for Djokovic as well. In a thrilling first set, Dolgopolov managed to outplay the Serbian, utilizing his accurate serves and powerful groundstrokes. However, after receiving treatment to his feet during an on-court injury time-out, Dolgopolov appeared to struggle with mobility, making it easier for Djokovic to capitalize on the situation. The world No. 1 displayed his signature skill and agility to level the match by winning the second set. Dolgopolov's form seemed to decline further in the deciding set, and Djokovic was able to exploit his opponent's weakness, securing a victory and earning a place in the quarterfinals.

Instead the Staffordshire-Boxer cross ended up nearly burning the house down and killing his owner's son. The dog caused a severe fire after managing to switch on the cooker while trying to reach his dog treats. The heat from one of the hob's rings set fire to a child's seat that had been left resting on the electric appliance. Fire starter: Hungry Leo almost burned down his owner's home as he hunted for his dog treats . The blaze was started after the Staffordshire-Boxer cross was believed to have knocked one of the cooker knobs, switching on the hob . Smoke began to fill the three storey home in Peckham, south-east London, as owner Allen Mosey's son, 21, and his daughter's boyfriend relaxed in upstairs rooms. The pair managed to flee unharmed with Leo after noticing thick black smoke billowing up the stairs. More than 10 firefighters were needed to extinguish the flames. A search of the house later revealed that the source of fire was the cooker. Firefighters believe that when Leo was hunting for food he knocked one of the cooker's knobs, turning the rings on. The blaze damaged one third of the ground floor of the property and Leo's family have been left surviving on sandwiches.

It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline. Great chunks of what makes The Lord Of The Rings what it is, is simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects can't do Tolkien's (and your own) imagination justice.

Early revascularization is independently predictive of a lower risk of ischemic stroke, but the mechanism of this does not appear to be related to improved cardiac function. The records of 45,997 subjects who received thrombolytic therapy and 47,876 patients who were treated with primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for myocardial infarction were analyzed to determine the relationship between time to revascularization and the occurrence of ischemic stroke. A statistically significant linear relationship between time to revascularization therapy and risk of in-hospital ischemic stroke was seen on univariate analysis. A multivariate model incorporating 26 other variables showed thrombolytic therapy within 15 minutes of presentation was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke, and angioplasty within 90 minutes was similarly associated with a nonsignificant trend toward lower stroke risk.", "Person1: Dad, why were you asking so many questions about admission requirements of college?

It ticked all the boxes in terms of storytelling, acting, and visual appeal - a testament to the talents of its cast and crew. The powerful emotions it evoked will stay with me for a long time, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an unforgettable cinematic experience.", "I am a huge fan of the first four Ju-on projects, so naturally, I was thrilled to see the next installment in this iconic horror franchise. The film offers the same eerie atmosphere, spine-chilling visuals, and relentless scares that I've come to expect from this series. However, the filmmakers manage to breathe new life into the familiar storyline by presenting fresh twists and unexpected turns, ensuring that even the most die-hard Ju-on fans will be on the edge of their seats. The acting in this installment is top-notch - the cast delivers emotionally resonant performances, making it easy to become invested in their characters' fates. The cinematography captures the unsettling nature of the Saeki curse brilliantly, with its dark corners and ominously creaking doors that are reminiscent of the first films. The art direction and makeup effects team has also done an outstanding job, as the ghoulish and unearthly entities that inhabit this cursed house have never looked better (or scarier). One of the most terrifying aspects of the Ju-on series has been the ability of the films to build an almost unbearable sense of dread through atmospheric tension, rather than relying solely on jump scares (though there are plenty of those). This installment doesn't disappoint in that respect, with several climactic sequences that left me holding my breath in suspense. While there are some minor pacing issues and a few slightly less effective scares in the middle section of the film, the overall experience delivers enough terror and shock value to satisfy any horror fanatic. In addition, newcomers to the Ju-on series will likely find this entry to be as genuinely frightening as longtime fans. In conclusion, this latest addition to the Ju-on franchise is a must-see for fans of the series and horror enthusiasts alike. It successfully builds on the strengths of its predecessors, effectively raising the bar for contemporary supernatural horror films. Don't be surprised if you find yourself staying away from dark rooms and attic spaces after watching this terrifying tale.", "Just reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini series reminded me how much I enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago. At the time I remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer ,two talented actors that we don't see enough of on TV or cinema these days. I have tried without success to obtain several of the BBCs fantastic dramas from the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories, which sadly the BBC seem to have no intention of releasing on video or DVD.

Our data also showed that this pattern of disease is significantly associated with tissue loss and critical limb ischemia, particularly in patients 80years of age. Primary care providers need to be educated to suspect ischemic etiology for foot pain and ulcers in elderly patients not otherwise thought to have risk factors associated with PAD. Vascular specialists need to anticipate this pattern of disease when planning interventions. As smoking becomes less prevalent and as the population ages, octogenarians with severe infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease will become a larger proportion of the patients treated by vascular specialists.", "Blackpool striker Nile Ranger has accused the club of 'taking the mick' out of him by giving him such a low-paid contract that it left him wondering how he would fill his fridge with food.

The opening sequence, filled with stunning visuals and a haunting score, sets the stage for a story that promises to keep you on the edge of your seat. The world-building is rich and intricate, making you feel as if you've been transported into the alternate universe crafted by the filmmakers. The performances delivered by the lead actors are strong and riveting, holding your attention from beginning to end. They carry the emotional weight of the film, drawing you into their stories and making you care about their fates. The supporting cast adds depth and texture, complementing the leads and providing an impressive ensemble. However, somewhere around the midway point, the pace starts to slow down and the narrative begins to meander. Some of the subplots feel unnecessary, taking away from the main story and leaving the viewer wishing for more focus on the primary plotline. Additionally, the film's runtime feels slightly overstretched, with certain scenes dragging on for too long, diluting the impact they were intended to have. Despite these flaws, the film still manages to deliver on the excitement front, with well-choreographed action sequences and breathtaking visual effects. The climax, while somewhat predictable, provides a satisfying resolution, tying up loose ends and leaving the audience with a sense of catharsis. Overall, while this movie doesn't quite reach the heights it sets out to achieve, it is still an entertaining and engaging journey, worth watching for its strong lead performances, immersive world-building, and thrilling action set pieces.", "Yes, a psychological approach to successful aging can predict future quality of life in older adults. This approach focuses on factors such as attitude, resilience, optimism, cognitive functioning, and emotional well-being, which play a significant role in determining how well an older individual adapts to the aging process and maintains a high quality of life. Several studies have found that older adults who maintain a positive attitude, engage in mentally stimulating activities, and effectively manage stress and emotions tend to have a better quality of life. Furthermore, both physical and mental health contribute to an older individual's ability to successfully age, and addressing psychological factors is crucial in optimizing overall well-being. The psychological approach highlights the importance of maintaining a sense of purpose, fostering strong social connections, and staying engaged in meaningful activities throughout the aging process. By adopting this approach, older adults can actively work towards enhancing their future quality of life and living a fulfilling, healthy, and independent life.", "I was laughing so hard most of the time that I had people glaring at me because they couldn't hear over my laughter.

Hadi still claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. Since mid-March, more than 700 people have been killed in violence that shows no sign of slowing, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Houthis say they have the support of the country's people behind them. \"It's the right of the Yemeni people to stand against the attacks in all possible means as long as the attacks continue,\" Al-Houthi said Sunday. \"After our people move and react against the attacks and killing of children and women, we do not want to hear any voices and cries.\" But there are signs of some fracturing among forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, many of whom have fought alongside the rebels. Gen. AbdulRahman AlHalili, who leads more than 10,000 troops, has now allied himself with Hadi, military sources said Sunday. Meanwhile, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri said Sunday that airstrikes had decimated the Houthis' central command by targeting their communications. The rebels, he said, are now holding a defensive stance in besieged areas. Since it began the campaign known as Operation Decisive Storm on March 26, the Saudi-led coalition has launched 2,300 airstrikes, Asiri said.

In many cases, male fish exhibit different colour morphs that are linked to alternative mating strategies. These strategies could include territorial defense, female mimicry, or sneaking to increase their success in mate acquisition. The presence of intrasexual competition, particularly for limited mating opportunities, can drive the evolution of these alternative mating strategies as different colour morphs may be associated with different levels of success in finding mates and reproducing. For example, in some species, brightly coloured males may have a higher success rate in attracting females compared to less colourful males, while less colourful males may need to rely on deception or sneak tactics. In such cases, competition within the species can drive the maintenance and evolution of colour polymorphisms and associated mating strategies. One well-studied example of this phenomenon is the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). Males of this species occur in three different throat colours (orange, blue, and yellow), and each colour morph is associated with a different mating strategy. Orange males are territorial and aggressive, blue males form pairs and guard females, and yellow males mimic female appearance to sneak copulations. Intrasexual competition among males drives the existence and frequency of these different strategies, as each colour morph may have different fitness advantages depending on the local competitive environment. While this example is from lizards, similar principles can also apply to fish species that exhibit colour polymorphism. Therefore, intrasexual competition can indeed facilitate the evolution of alternative mating strategies in a colour polymorphic fish.", "Bradley Dew has been jailed for mugging his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a 10 note . A thug has been jailed after he mugged his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a 10 note. Bradley Dew, 26, had been drinking with his friend at a pub in Faversham in Kent earlier that day and had borrowed his mobile. But later in the evening Dew returned to his friend's home, claiming he had lost the mobile on a train after returning from Herne Bay. As the friend said he was about to go out with his girlfriend, Dew pushed him back into a wall before striking him across the face. He then stole 10 out of his wallet. Dew, of Faversham, then fled the scene, and was found by police hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend's home hours later on March 29 last year. Officers said he was likely to have been left feeling vulnerable after being mugged in his own home. Dew denied stealing from his friend, and told officers it would have been 'like robbing my brother.' However he was found guilty of robbery and assault, following a trial held at Maidstone Crown Court. Detective Constable Kathryn Lumsden-Earle, of Kent Police, said: 'Dew took advantage of a so-called friend's generosity, taking his phone and then never returning it. 'He then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet. 'He did all of this in the victim's own home, which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety. 'Time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day, but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend.'

Hydrogen bonds are crucial for protein folding, stability, and function. They contribute to the formation and stabilization of secondary structures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, and are also involved in tertiary and quaternary structures. Proteins within a family often have similar sequences and structures, and share common functions. The hydrogen bond networks are an essential aspect of these structural and functional similarities. The presence, absence, or alteration of hydrogen bonds can influence the properties of a protein, affecting its stability, flexibility, and interactions with other molecules. In some cases, subtle changes in hydrogen bond networks can lead to functional diversity within a protein family. These networks are also crucial to the folding process of proteins, as they help to guide and stabilize the formation of the final folded structure. Proper folding is critical for protein function, and disruption of hydrogen bond networks can lead to misfolding and aggregation, which are implicated in various diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion-related diseases. In summary, hydrogen bond networks play a significant role in determining the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of proteins in a protein family. They are critical for proper protein folding, stability, and function, and their alteration can lead to variations in properties or even dysfunction and disease.", "Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are a class of drugs commonly used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Since the introduction of the first PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), in 1998, several other drugs have been developed and approved for use in treating ED. These include vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis), and avanafil (Stendra). Mechanism of Action: PDE5 inhibitors work by promoting relaxation of the smooth muscle tissues of the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased blood flow to the penile shaft and erection. They achieve this by selectively inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzyme type 5, which is responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the penile smooth muscle cells. With PDE5 inhibition, cGMP levels increase, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and enhanced blood flow. Efficacy and Safety: Numerous clinical trials and analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors in improving erectile function in men with ED of varying etiologies, including organic, psychogenic, and mixed causes. PDE5 inhibitors have been found to be effective in treating ED in men with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. In general, PDE5 inhibitors are well-tolerated by most patients. Common side effects include headache, facial flushing, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, and back pain. These side effects are typically mild and transient. However, more severe side effects such as the risk of priapism, sudden hearing loss, and vision disturbances have been reported, although they are rare. Contraindications to the use of PDE5 inhibitors include concurrent use of nitrates and hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. Comparisons and Patient Preference: While all PDE5 inhibitors share a similar mechanism of action, there are several differences among them that may affect patients' preferences and treatment outcomes. Sildenafil and vardenafil have a shorter half-life (approximately 4-5 hours) and onset of action within 1 hour, whereas tadalafil has a longer half-life (approximately 17.5 hours) and onset of action within 30-45 minutes. Avanafil has the shortest onset of action (15-30 minutes) and a half-life of approximately 5 hours. These pharmacokinetic differences may translate into differences in duration of action and flexibility in the timing of sexual activity. Several studies have compared patients' preferences for different PDE5 inhibitors. Factors influencing preferences may include a drug's efficacy, side effect profile, cost, and ease of use. While some patients may prefer the faster onset of action and shorter duration of sildenafil or vardenafil, others may prefer the longer duration of action and flexibility provided by tadalafil. Conclusion: PDE5 inhibitors remain a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for ED, with a variety of options available to suit patients' individual needs and preferences. Ongoing research continues to explore novel PDE5 inhibitors and other pharmacological approaches for ED, as well as strategies to optimize patient outcomes. Product development, biotechnological innovations, combination therapies, and personalized medicine approaches are likely to shape the future landscape of ED treatment.", "Median tumor size was 3.4 cm (range: 0.7-18.0 cm), and median ischemia time was 21 min (range: 4-55 min).

In the picture, taken on a train platform in Rio de Janeiro, two women hug and gaze into each others' eyes, but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes. Brazilian man, Nelson Felippe posted this image, expressing his disapproval at the 'scene'. The viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant, as he mentions: 'They are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous' In his Facebook post, Felippe stated: 'I am not prejudiced, I think everyone does what they want out of your life. But I find it absurd that I should be forced to witness a scene like this. 'What one does in private is your business, but what you do in public concerns me yes. And I refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal.' A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line .

According to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau, the schoolboy's death earlier this month was 'a tragic accident' with no one to blame. The family, from Talybont-on-Usk, Wales, were enjoying their last run of the holiday when Antonia fell and her mother stopped to help. Carwyn carried on skiing and then ventured into a wooded area. His mother thought he had continued to their accommodation but raised the alarm when he did not return. Mr Michau said: 'The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste. The reason why is not known but it was by error. 'Had he been with someone bigger or older, the accident wouldn't have happened but it remains a dramatic and tragic accident.' In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'.

The 57-year-old, who was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 17, recognized that something was not right when he woke in the middle of the night to find that his leg was extremely cold. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Mabbutt recounted how he was forced to rush to the hospital at 5 AM after realizing that his leg had stopped working. Medical professionals informed the ex-Spurs star that the main artery had become completely blocked. As a result, he underwent an operation to replace the damaged artery, which saved his leg. If left untreated, this blockage could have led to the amputation of his limb. Mabbutt, who played over 600 games for Tottenham across a 16-year career, said the experience gave him a new perspective on the potential dangers of diabetes. \"Ever since I was 17, I've been having up to seven injections a day, and always watching my blood sugar levels and doing my blood tests,\" he recalled. However, the incident highlighted that the complications of diabetes can develop even for those who diligently manage their condition. More than four million people in the United Kingdom have diabetes, with the number expected to rise to five million within the next 20 years. Mabbutt hopes that sharing his story will help raise awareness about this widespread, yet often misunderstood, condition. He emphasized the importance of regular checkups, stating, \"Make sure you get checked out if you're feeling a bit sleepy, you're losing a bit of weight, and you're going to the toilet every five minutes - these are the signs of diabetes.\" The ex-footballer is dedicated to using his platform to promote education on diabetes and its potential dangers. By spotlighting his own experiences, he aims to show that vulnerability to complications does not diminish, even if one has been living with diabetes for a long time.", "Cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death, in attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. Certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark, and the acting occasionally goes over the top. But the underlying message - about God's and others' forgiveness for our real or perceived sins - is positive and unique in cinema, and the cast is very very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effectively done that, years after having seen it, I still get chills thinking about it. Highly recommended.", "The results implicate correlated activity between the cortex and the striatum, especially the nucleus accumbens core and the basolateral amygdala, in the generation of a conditioned motivated state that may promote excessive food intake. The upregulation of a number of genes in unique patterns within corticostriatal, thalamic, and hypothalamic networks suggests that food cues are capable of powerfully altering neuronal processing in areas mediating the integration of emotion, cognition, arousal, and the regulation of energy balance. As many of these genes play a role in plasticity, their upregulation within these circuits may also indicate the neuroanatomic and transcriptional correlates of extinction learning.", "A massive sandstorm engulfed the city of Golmud in China's northwestern region, leaving behind apocalyptic scenes resembling the surface of Mars. Incredible pictures captured by local residents show the entire city covered in brightly-colored sand, with the skies turning red during the 30-minute long event. Golmud, situated between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountains in the Qinghai province, experienced the intense sandstorm yesterday that forced its inhabitants to flee the streets. The region's sandy deserts and harsh climate makes it highly vulnerable to such weather-related incidents. This unusual phenomenon saw the swirling dust transform the city into a red hellscape, with visibility severely reduced. Several residents took to social media to share dramatic images of the surreal Mars-like environment, expressing fear and awe over the event. Sandstorms are common in China's northwestern regions during spring, usually occurring between April and June. The country has been grappling with increased desertification, particularly in its northern areas, as a consequence of climate change and human activities such as deforestation. Chinese authorities have adopted reforestation and desertification control measures to combat the rising issue of sandstorms plaguing various regions. In March 2021, Beijing was hit by its worst sandstorm in a decade, prompting the country to set a target planting of over 100,000 square kilometers of forests by the end of this year. Fortunately, the Golmud sandstorm did not last long, with no severe damage or casualties reported. However, it serves as a reminder of the increasing volatility of weather patterns worldwide and the necessity for sustainable management and conservation of natural resources.", "Viral marker data comparing confirmed seroprevalence in 1 (st) time volunteer non-remunerated donors (VNRD) and familyreplacement donors (FRD) corrected for gender and age, show no significant difference between the two groups. Evidence has been provided that for both VNRD and FAD benevolence is more appropriate than altruism. The two groups merge for psychological attitude to donation for which knowing someone needing transfusion is a powerful incentive to give blood. Excluding a life or death situation found in areas where severe blood shortage justifies replacement donation, pressures are exerted on both VNRD and FRD. There is no evidence of coercion of FRD. FRDs therefore meet all criteria for VNRD and are willing to become VNRD and to repeat donation. Ostracising FRD is illegitimate and damaging to the blood supply in resource poor areas. In some countries no difference is made between the two groups of donors representing similar populations asked to give blood in different circumstances.", "Just reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini series reminded me how much I enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago.

Doerr's novel had received rave reviews upon its release last spring. \"I must blame Anthony Doerr for lost sleep, because once I started reading his new novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See,' there was no putting it down,\" wrote William T. Vollmann in The New York Times Book Review. Doerr's work was also a finalist for the National Book Award. It's his second novel and fourth work of fiction, including two short story collections. 2015 Pulitzer Prize winners in journalism named . \"Between Riverside and Crazy,\" a play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, won the Pulitzer for drama. An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A.

The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University and are considered some of the most prestigious honors in journalism and literature.", "Restoration of tumor suppressor miR-34 has been shown to inhibit human p53-mutant gastric cancer tumorspheres in certain experimental settings. In a study by Song et al., it was demonstrated that restoring the miR-34 tumor suppressor could significantly inhibit the growth of p53-mutant gastric cancer tumorspheres, enhance cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis. Additionally, the restoration of miR-34 expression could suppress cancer stem cell properties and inhibit tumorsphere formation. Overall, these findings suggest that restoration of miR-34 has potential therapeutic implications for treating p53-mutant gastric cancer. However, more research is needed to confirm and better understand these findings.", "Yes, preclinical evidence does support the idea that activation of mesolimbic alpha 6 subunit containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (6-nAChRs) is involved in the development of nicotine addiction phenotype. Studies using rodent models have demonstrated that activation of these receptors is critical for the reinforcing effects of nicotine and the development of addiction-like behaviors. Specifically, 6-nAChRs are highly expressed in the mesolimbic dopamine system, which plays a vital role in mediating the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, including nicotine. Activation of 6-nAChRs on dopaminergic neurons can increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region associated with reward and motivation. This increase in dopamine release is thought to underlie the reinforcing properties of nicotine, contributing to the development of addiction. Further, genetic manipulation studies in rodents have shown that deletion or reduction in 6-nAChR function can decrease the reinforcing effects of nicotine and reduce addiction-related behaviors, such as self-administration and reinstatement. In summary, preclinical evidence indicates that activation of mesolimbic 6-nAChRs plays a crucial role in supporting the nicotine addiction phenotype. However, it is important to note that these findings are from animal models, and further research is needed to fully understand the role of these receptors in human nicotine addiction.", "Person1: Oh, nice!

However, the humble Spaniard insists that such comparisons are premature, labeling Scholes as a \"one off.\" Herrera has been an influential figure at Old Trafford since his arrival in 2014, helping the team to secure a top-four finish in the 201415 season and adding vital goals and creativity to manager Louis van Gaal's side. Recent performances have seen fans and pundits alike highlight the similarities between Herrera and the ginger-haired genius who ruled the United midfield for almost 20 years. But Herrera is determined not to get carried away, paying tribute to the man who won 11 Premier League titles, three FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League trophies with the Red Devils. In a recent interview, Herrera said, \"I feel very proud when somebody says I can play like him, but I think it's almost impossible to be like him. He's a one off. There's only one Paul Scholes, but I try to learn from other players, and I'm always trying to improve.\" Adding to his comments on Scholes, Herrera continued: \"Being compared to a player like Paul Scholes is extremely flattering, but I still have a long way to go to attain the level of mastery and consistency that he displayed for Manchester United.\" While his exploits for Manchester United have featured numerous moments of brilliance, Herrera revealed that his favorite goal for the club came against Yeovil Town in the FA Cup third round in January 2015. The midfielder's sweetly struck volley from outside the box secured United's place in the fourth round as they went on to lift the trophy at the end of that season. Herrera's growing stature at Old Trafford has seen him become a fan favorite and a key player under new manager Jose Mourinho. If he can continue to display his current form, both creatively and in front of goal, it may not be long before the comparisons to Paul Scholes become more frequent and deserved. For now, Ander Herrera remains focused on the task at hand, as Manchester United continue their push for another Premier League title and European success in the coming years. United supporters worldwide will be hoping that the Spaniard continues to shine in the heart of the team's midfield, helping to propel the iconic football club back to the pinnacle of the sport.", "Central venous catheter (CVC) -related infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. These infections can lead to extended hospitalizations, increased healthcare costs, and negative outcomes for the patient. Identifying risk factors and understanding the prevalence of CVC-related infections in burn patients is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. Prevalence of CVC-related infection in burn patients: Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of CVC-related infections in burn patients. The rates of CVC-related infection in burn patients ranges between 5 and 41. This variation in prevalence could be attributed to factors such as differences in patient populations, types of burn injuries, CVC insertion sites, and management protocols. Risk factors for CVC-related infection in burn patients: 1. Severity of burn injury: Patients with severe burns are at a higher risk of developing CVC-related infections due to the disruption of the skin barrier, compromised immune response, and the need for prolonged CVC use. 2. Catheter duration: The risk of infection increases with the duration of catheterization. Studies have found that CVCs used for more than seven days are associated with a higher risk of infection compared to those used for a shorter period. 3. CVC insertion site: The subclavian and internal jugular venous sites are associated with a lower risk of infection than the femoral site. 4. Catheter care: Poor adherence to catheter care protocols, such as aseptic technique during insertion and maintenance, increases the risk of CVC-related infections. 5. Age and comorbidities: Older patients and those with underlying medical comorbidities are at a higher risk of developing CVC-related infections. Prevention strategies to reduce the prevalence of CVC-related infection in burn patients: 1. Educating healthcare personnel about proper aseptic technique during CVC insertion and maintenance, as well as the importance of adhering to infection control guidelines. 2. Implementing a CVC bundle, which includes a combination of evidence-based practices, such as hand hygiene, maximal sterile barrier precautions during insertion, chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, and timely removal of the CVC when no longer needed. 3. Utilizing antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, which have been shown to reduce the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections. 4. Regular assessment of the patient's clinical status and need for the CVC, and prompt removal when it is no longer necessary. In summary, the prevalence of CVC-related infection in burn patients remains a significant issue. Understanding the risk factors and implementing evidence-based prevention strategies are crucial to reduce the rate of these infections and improve patient outcomes. Further research is essential to better understand the risk factors and develop more targeted interventions for this vulnerable patient population.", "The average Briton enjoys 884 cups of tea each year - or enough to fill two bathtubs, a survey has found. The YouGov poll of more than 2,000 Britons revealed that we consume an average of 17 cups of tea each week. The research showed that our tea-drinking habits increase as we get older, with those aged 55 and over typically enjoying 21 cups of tea a week compared with 18 to 24-year-olds, who only drink eight cups a week. The average Briton enjoys 884 cups of tea each year - or enough to fill two bathtubs, a survey has found . The poll also found that almost a third of women turn to a cuppa to make them feel better when they are unwell - in comparison with only 16 per cent of men. Youngsters are more likely to turn to a cuppa when they are sad, with nearly a quarter of 18 to 25s saying they put the kettle on when they are feeling down, compared with just 11 per cent of 55 and overs. And more than half of adults associated a cup of tea with 'comfort and relaxation' - confirming the results of a separate survey which yesterday revealed that sweet tea promotes relaxation and relieves stress. Mary Rance, chief executive of charity Contact The Elderly - which commissioned the poll and organises tea parties for older people - said: 'This confirms that tea really is part of our national identity. We know from our parties and our research that a cup of tea brings Britain together.' The poll found that almost a third of women turn to a cuppa to make them feel better when they are unwell .

First of all, Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first few minutes. Definite plus. Didn't see that one coming. I didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head, either. If the movie had kept up those kind of thrills, I would have loved it. The beginning showed so much promise. I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one.

The seizures, described as the most successful run for drug seizures since 2009, took place in 19 separate incidents, including a 10-ton bust from a coastal freighter, marking the largest maritime drug interdiction in the area over the last decade. Authorities have praised the work of the joint US and Canadian forces, citing the arrests and seizures as a significant step in their ongoing fight against drug trafficking. \"Crews operating these ships are out there day and night working to take drugs out of circulation and dismantle the criminal networks that profit from the suffering these drugs cause,\" said Admiral Craig Faller, commander of US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in the Western Hemisphere. The increase in seizures also highlights the ongoing challenge of drug trafficking in the region. Many drug cartels have turned to maritime routes to smuggle their contraband, benefiting from the vast and remote nature of the oceans, as well as minimal law enforcement presence in the area. The joint effort between the US and Canadian navies has been hailed as a successful collaboration in the fight against international drug trafficking. The latest blows to the criminal networks involved in the cartel operations in Central and South America are a significant step forward for the authorities, but with the demand for narcotics remaining high in North America, the battle to disrupt the supply chain continues.", "Person1: Well, the facilities are impressive and the work environment seems quite conducive to productivity. I believe having a good workspace plays a big role in job satisfaction.", "\"Don't Torture a Duckling\" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. Released in 1972 and directed by the maestro of giallo, Lucio Fulci, this film offers that delightful blend of mystery, gore and social criticism that made Italian classics of the time stand out. Set in a small, rural village in southern Italy, the film follows the horrific serial murders of young children. The local community is riddled with superstition, religious fervor, and palpable tension. It's a slow burn but that's what makes it even more exciting. Unlike other giallo films, Fulci focused on creating a dark atmosphere, exquisite cinematography, and well-developed characters. The acting is on point, especially from Florinda Bolkan who plays the mysterious Maciara, a woman accused of witchcraft. Her performance is as intense as it is delicate, and you can't help but feel a connection with her. The soundtrack by Riz Ortolani is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly encapsulating the eerie atmosphere of the film. What sets \"Don't Torture a Duckling\" apart from other Italian horror films of the time is its social commentary. Fulci explores themes of religious fanaticism, paranoia, and mob mentality in a way that makes you question the true nature of evil. While \"Don't Torture a Duckling\" may lack some of the more over-the-top scenes of its gory contemporaries, it compensates with a compelling story, interesting characters, and a chilling atmosphere. It's a hidden gem worthy of discovery for fans of classic Italian horror and a testament to the genius of Lucio Fulci. If you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this twisted tale of mystery, religion and murder.", "Person1: That's interesting!

The Spaniard has faced criticism for persisting with the same style of play, moving the ball on the ground out from defence. Martinez insists that he is 'innovative' in his tactics and points to the adjustments he made during Everton's win over Southampton on Saturday. In that game, the Toffee's coach shifted from his preferred 4-2-3-1 to an unorthodox 3-4-3 formation, showcasing his ability to adapt and change his tactics when necessary. \"I know that it has been said that I am stubborn with my tactics, but I think that we have shown we can be innovative and adaptable when necessary,\" Martinez said. \"Against Southampton, we made a few changes and got the result that we wanted.\" Everton's 3-0 win over Southampton was a much-needed boost after a disappointing end to last season, and Martinez believes that the team is heading in the right direction. \"I believe that we have a strong team and that we will continue to get better as the season progresses,\" Martinez continued. \"We have a great blend of experienced players and young talent, and I am confident that we can achieve our goals this season.\" Further defending his tactics, Martinez added that his possession-based style has been successful in the past, particularly during his time at Swansea City and Wigan Athletic. \"I've always believed in playing a brand of football that focuses on moving the ball out from the defensive areas and retaining possession,\" he said. \"It's worked well for my teams in the past and I believe that it can work for Everton, too.\" The Everton boss has also received support from his players, with midfielder Gareth Barry commenting that the team is fully behind their manager's tactics. \"We all have belief in the style of play and the tactics that the manager wants us to employ,\" Barry said. \"We know that if we stick to the game plan and execute it properly, we can get the results that we desire.\" Ultimately, Martinez is adamant that his tactical approach can bring success to Everton this season. As the team continues to adapt and improve, he will be hoping that the results will silence his critics once and for all.", "A Toronto tower crane operator took pictures of a raccoon that climbed almost 700 feet up a metal ladder before taking a high-altitude poop.

The show, created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, follows the journey of Miriam \"Midge\" Maisel, a housewife turned stand-up comic, as she navigates a male-dominated industry and challenges societal norms of her time. Rachel Brosnahan's phenomenal performance as Midge breathes life into every scene with her impeccable comic timing and emotionally charged moments. The supporting cast, including Tony Shalhoub, Alex Borstein, and Marin Hinkle, adds layers of complexity and charm to the story. The show is visually stunning, with its vibrant sets, colorful costumes, and beautifully crafted cinematography that not only capture the essence of the era but transport you, the viewer, to the heart of New York City in its golden age. The pacing is perfect, blending high-energy comedy with heartfelt dramatic moments in a seamless narrative that keeps the audience engaged and invested. \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" is not only a phenomenal example of great storytelling and acting, but it also explores themes of feminism, self-discovery, and resilience that resonate with viewers even today.

Implications for Rehabilitation Even in patients with mild symptoms not awaiting hip replacement a generalized muscle weakening of the symptomatic lower extremity seems to be present. Between-leg differences in leg extensor power (forcevelocity) appears to be relatively large (19) in patients with unilateral hip osteoarthritis in contrast to healthy peers who show no asymmetry.

The main characters name is Tamura , played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. Like this, he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease. But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. Throughout the whole movie, Tamura remains a bit cowardish, but very civil, when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival Tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade. A scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is, when Tamura comes into a Phillipino village which is completely deserted. There, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is. That shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly. After he turns away from the corpses, two Phillipinos (a couple or brother and sister: very close relationship) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back. The main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first, although he walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman once she starts screaming. Her brotherboyfriendhusband then runs away in fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino. He does not hit him. After Tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very precious , he drops his gun into a river. This gesture is very important in order to understand Kon Ichikawa'sShohei Ooka's profiling of Tamura and the war. Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies, it is not typical at all. Of course all movies have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope. This is typical for Japanese World War two movies and for Japanese society. Since World War two is not a discussed theme in Japanese society, Japanese are likely to put Japanese in the second World War in the role of the victim. This victimisation is also very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamura, another one the piled up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is, when the Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the Japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike. In my personal conclusion I have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. It also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in. Once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horrors of the second World War to its total extent.", "Underwater Footage Offers a Glimpse into the Secret Lives of Zoo Animals A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv has captured unparalleled footage of the secret lives of zoo animals by placing a GoPro camera at the bottom of the animals' water troughs. The final video, which was cut down to four minutes from 30 hours of recordings, offers viewers a \"completely unique perspective\" of the animals, according to the zookeeper. The innovative experiment was conducted by a staff member at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, who wanted to give visitors a better understanding of the various species that call the zoo their home. By placing a GoPro at the bottom of the animals' respective water troughs, the zookeeper managed to capture amazing moments of them drinking, bathing, and interacting with their aquatic environments. The resulting footage offers a rare glimpse into the natural behaviors and routines of these creatures when they are not being watched by the public. Among the highlights are stunning close-ups of giraffes, elephants, and birds as they drink and bathe, as well as candid moments of playfulness between animals. The innovative filming technique provides a valuable learning tool for both the public and researchers alike, as it sheds light on the lesser-known aspects of animal behavior. The zookeeper behind the project hopes that the footage will inspire more curiosity and appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the animal kingdom. The Zoological Center in Tel Aviv plans to use the footage as part of its educational programs and exhibits, allowing visitors to catch a glimpse of the wildlife from a unique and intimate angle. Additionally, the footage may also be used by researchers to gain further insights into animal behavior and interactions. This creative approach to showcasing the animals in a new light is in line with the zoological center's commitment to raising awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation and providing engaging, informative experiences for its guests. So the next time you visit the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, be sure to take a closer look at the underwater world of the animals - you might just discover something amazing!", "Person1: I don't know what I'm going to do! It's going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job! Person2: Don't worry. I don't think you're going to lose your job over one mistake. Person1: It was a rather big mistake. When you work as an investment adviser, one small mistake can cost the company millions. Person2: But it wasn't just you who was involved, right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do. Person1: That's true, but my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth.

The inhuman interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian Chief of Police, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide - bomb plot, thus entwining the two main plot-lines of the movie. Both work very well, the bombing set-piece graphic and chilling in its realism, with its denouement revealed in a stylish Tarantino-type flashback and the torture scenes on an innocent man also unflinchingly portrayed in all their gory detail. The film scores telling points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence - gathering in the war against terrorists and against the unpoliced faceless bureaucracy (here personified by a suitable cold-steeled Meryl Streep, as the CIA boss who casually gives the order for rendition) which can ruin innocent lives. Never mind Kafka's fiction, think more the recent killing of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the Head of the Metropolitan police still in his job and no-one tried for the poor man's murder. The acting is excellent throughout - the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber are realistically and tellingly played by the unfamiliar actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly Yigal Naor as the intimidating Chief of Police and Zineb Ouhach as his idealistic lovelorn daughter ring true with their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least to me) adding to their characters' credibility. Of the bigger Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's stature grows with succeeding films, here playing the initially detached but later conscience - stricken and anguished Government man who does the right thing in the end. Witherspoon plays her distraught wife part mainly in one key but is believable all the same, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly show up self-serving senators and their lackeys who'll only go so far to help you until their career prospects are jeopardised. There are a few weaknesses plot-wise; there's little dramatic need to create the \"suspense\" surrounding El-Ibrahimi's escape and Streep's character is perhaps too obvious a bogey-manwoman. Worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's on-the-spot girlfriend, around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love-scene. On the whole though, an engrossing thought - provoking cinematic experience.", "Robert Penny, an 83-year-old man, has been charged with the murder of two women in a cold case that dates back to 1991. One of the victims, Margaret Penny, was the accused's wife, and the other woman, Claire Acocks, was an acquaintance. Both women were found viciously stabbed, their throats slashed, and wrapped in hair wraps in an apparent attempt to hide their identities. Penny was initially cleared of any involvement in the gruesome killings during the original investigation that took place shortly after the murders. However, new evidence pertaining to the decades-old case led authorities to revisit the crime and subsequently charge Penny with the double homicide. The unsolved brutal murder case of the two women has haunted the small community for almost three decades. Residents have had to live with the knowledge that the perpetrator of such a heinous crime had remained at large all these years. The arrest and charging of Penny will hopefully bring some long-awaited closure and justice to the families and friends of the victims. Considering the age of the accused and the length of time that has passed since the crime, the trial and potential conviction of Penny may prove to be a complex and challenging legal case for the prosecutors, defense, and jury. \"We understand that there will be technicalities and difficulties, but we are very confident in the evidence we've amassed, and we believe that we will be able to make a successful case for the prosecution of Robert Penny for these tragic murders,\" said a spokesperson for the prosecution. Although Penny was previously cleared of any involvement in the case, the new evidence has left many questioning the effectiveness of the initial investigation. The charges against the elderly man, once deemed innocent, shine a light on the potential for miscarriages of justice and the need for vigilance in upholding the integrity of the legal system. As the case progresses, many will undoubtedly be left anxious for the outcome, hoping for a resolution in a crime that has for too long remained unsolved.", "A couple of days ago I saw the awesome \"House of Sand and Fog\" and I was impressed with the amazing performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see \"Ray,\" trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar of Best Lead Actor. After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be awarded. I like Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates of most of the shootings, and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles. With regard to the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie Ray Charles. My greatest surprise was to find that Ray Charles was heroine addicted, and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Ray\"", "title: Barcelona on Track for a Semi-Final Spot After Triumph Over Paris Saint-Germain author: Staff Writer Barcelona now have one foot in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals after a commanding 3-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night. Luis Suarez was once again in great form, scoring a brace, while Neymar added a goal to ensure a convincing win for the Spanish giants. PSG head coach Laurent Blanc did not offer any excuses for his team's defeat, acknowledging the dominance of their opponents. \"We didn't play as well as we could have, but facing a team like Barcelona, it's never easy,\" said Blanc. Suarez was the man of the match, with his extraordinary performance inspiring his teammates. The Uruguayan star managed to break through PSG's defence in the 67th minute before adding a second goal just six minutes later. Neymar, the Brazilian forward, had earlier given Barca the lead after 18 minutes. On the other hand, PSG looked nothing like the team that had eliminated the competition's defending champions, Chelsea, in the previous round. They were unable to contain Barcelona's lethal attacking duo of Suarez and Neymar, while also lacking creativity and penetration on the offensive end. A late goal by Gregory van der Wiel offered some consolation for the home side, but it will take a miraculous effort in the second leg to eliminate Barcelona now. The return leg between the two clubs is scheduled for March 21st, with PSG travelling to the intimidating Camp Nou stadium to face a Barcelona side in great form. With Lionel Messi also in fine fettle, Barca are likely to be a formidable challenge for the French champions. Barcelona's victory over PSG reinforces their status as one of the tournament favourites, as they continue their pursuit of the Champions League title. With their domestic league also within reach, the Catalan giants are well on their way to a successful season.", "Yes, auditory brain stem implants (ABIs) can evoke brain stem responses by stimulating the mature cochlear nucleus. An ABI is a surgically implanted device that directly stimulates the cochlear nucleus in the brain stem, bypassing the inner ear and the auditory nerve. It is typically used for patients who are not candidates for cochlear implants due to issues with their cochlear nerve or inner ear. When an ABI is in place and providing electrical stimulation to the cochlear nucleus, it can evoke brain stem responses, or auditory evoked potentials. These brain stem responses are often assessed and measured during the implant fitting and mapping process to ensure proper function and to create the best possible programming for the user. Through these responses, clinicians can gain insight into the functional status of the auditory pathway and the effectiveness of the ABI's stimulation. It is important to note that although ABIs can evoke brain stem responses, the outcomes and level of auditory performance can vary greatly among individuals, depending on various factors such as the etiology of hearing loss, anatomical considerations, and the integrity of the auditory pathway.", "Person1: You're welcome!

Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners. The owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on Scott.In an effort to boost the audience base and revenues, Reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case, and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play. Scott enlists the aid of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it on the air.The Pembroke Murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband, the circumstances of which are not made clear. However Gloria Pembroke has married, and is now living as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to be married (on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). About to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped. Simultaneously, Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place.Without revealing the final outcome, the film takes a devastating turn to jolt the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station, vigorously admonishing Scott and the sniveling Reynolds. While accepting his share of the blame for the outcome, Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, firing his secretary, and hauling her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. With an entirely abrupt finish, the film leaves one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending. With about a dozen films under his belt, Humphrey Bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with intriguing results. With no name supporting players, Bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices, and runs the show as if it was his own. In an interesting bit of characterization, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head, predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in \"Casablanca.\" For Bogart fans, it's a genuine treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this.", "Yes, hubs with network motifs can organize modularity dynamically in the protein-protein interaction network of yeast. In such networks, hubs represent highly connected proteins, and network motifs are recurring patterns of interconnections. These hubs and motifs play crucial roles in the organization, stability, and functionality of the protein interaction network. A study by Han et al., published in Nature, 2004, titled \"Evidence for dynamically organized modularity in the yeast protein-protein interaction network\" found that hubs in the yeast protein-protein interaction network could be classified into two types: \"party\" hubs that interact with most of their partners simultaneously, and \"date\" hubs that bind different partners at different times or locations. They found that date hubs were often associated with network motifs and showed dynamic behavior, organizing modularity in the protein interaction network. These dynamic hubs enable the network to be adaptable and responsive to changes in environmental conditions or cellular processes. Furthermore, the modularity in protein-protein interaction networks contributes to the robustness of the system, allowing for efficient cellular functioning and adaptability. By organizing modularity dynamically, hubs with network motifs help the network effectively coordinate different modules within the cellular system and maintain overall network stability.", "I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end. He died. He freaking died. I couldn't believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge like most coming into this film. It taught me a harsh lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most movies teach us. I just watched the film again tonight and was engaged all over again... and a little saddened.8 out of 10, but I'll admit to a little bias.", "Salvina Formosa does weights and sit-to-stand exercises every week to improve her fitness .

WSLHD's coordinator Shayda Marek said: 'We've seen an increase in confidence in a participant's mobility, strength and balance. This has positive effect on in their daily life, mentally and physically.' An evaluation report of the program showed that 70 per cent of participants improved their performance in balance and strength at the completion of the program. More than 83 per cent of participants reported changes in their behaviour since the program, such as doing more exercise at home, wearing safer footwear and reducing hazards in their home environment.", "Last year, Bacary Sagna left Arsenal for Manchester City, a move that the defender has not regreted despite City being behind FA Cup finalists Arsenal and facing a season without a prize.

In an exclusive interview, Sagna stated, \"I joined City because I wanted to take up new challenges. I was ready for that challenge and I do not regret my choice.\" Sagna also noted that he was proud of the work his teammates at City were doing, even though they were lagging behind his former team, Arsenal.

Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, in a news release and wanted poster distributed online, offers the reward for the death or capture of Houthi leader Abdelmalik Bedrudin Al-Houthi and former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Converted to currency, the gold reward would be worth about 774,000. AQAP referred to Al-Houthi and Saleh as the \"two heads of evil.\" AQAP is one of several factions fighting to control Yemen. With Sunni Islamic roots, AQAP is a bitter enemy of the Houthi faction, which is Shia and widely believed to be supported by Iran. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis, allied with fighters loyal to Saleh, have since faced resistance from not only AQAP, but also a number of groups including forces loyal to Hadi. Also opposing the Houthis are Saudi Arabia and other predominantly Sunni nations, which last month began airstrikes against the rebels. At least 540 people including 311 civilians have died as a result of the fighting, the United Nations said Wednesday. A U.N. expert on refugees said other nations should prepare for \"massive displacement\" of Yemenis seeking safety. \"The international community must prepare for a worst case scenario,\" Chaloka Beyani, a professor of International Law at the London School of Economics, said. \"While efforts to reach a diplomatic solution are essential, the picture on the ground is extremely bleak and humanitarian responses must be stepped up as a matter of urgency.\" About 1,000 people have already fled their homes during the two weeks of conflict.", "Person1: That sounds amazing!

The short movie made by him for Lumiere et Companie, the one with the eggs, that one is unbeatable in my heart, but this is wonderful, too. I liked it better than Ten. Kiarostami is, maybe, the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! He doesn't need to use a lot of stuff \"brought from home\" to illustrate his images, he simply grabs a camera. Not many can do that.. Maybe I don't know to much about movies but I don't care about complicate stuff, all someone has to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami does.", "I honestly expected more from this movie. The trailers led me to believe that this would be the summer blockbuster to end all others, but my high hopes were ultimately dashed. The plot of the film was convoluted and filled with too many subplots, making it difficult to emotionally invest in any one character or storyline. While the visuals and special effects were impressive, they couldn't mask the lack of strong writing and character development. The acting was subpar, with some members of the cast seemingly phoning in their performances. This was disappointing, especially given the incredible pool of talent and range these actors have displayed in other projects. The pacing of the film was uneven, with scenes dragging on too long, only to have a major plot point resolved within a matter of seconds. This left little room for tension or excitement to build up, resulting in an overall flat and emotionless viewing experience. However, the soundtrack was one of the few highlights of the film, with a pulsating score that attempted to inject a sense of urgency into the hollow plot. In the end, the movie failed to live up to the hype and left me feeling underwhelmed. It's a shame when such potential is squandered, but this film serves as a cautionary tale that spectacle and star power alone can't carry a film when the script and direction are lacking.", "This movie was so awful i don't even know where to begin...The only positive thing i can say about it is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. The entire movie was all over the place, there was no explanation as to the cause (only theories) of the eruptions, or rationals for their solutions or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy, you just wanna laugh!! There was just no background to any of them. The \"love\" relationship seemed to have been added on to the script, it was so awkward. There's an army man; big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with the \"AaarrrGH!i'm the Man!\" attitude, such a pathetic bad guy. The two sidekicks, who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys. And then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on somebody's shoulder and for the rest of the movie he's coughing as if he was dying of a pneumonia or something...and then plays hero (cheesiest scene of all!!) to help the plan which is to do who knows what... its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of THE dramatic scene...in a nutshell; don't waste your time!", "A repeats-enriched cytogenetic marker to identify A and D sub-genomes of Gossypium was discovered by FISH. Combined sequences analysis with FISH verification, the assembly quality of repetitive sequences in the allotetraploidy cotton draft genome was assessed, and better chromosome belonging was verified. We also found the genomic distribution of the identified Gypsy-LTR-RT was similar to the distribution of heterochromatin. The expansion of this type of Gypsy-LTR-RT in heterochromatic regions may be one of the major reasons for the size gap between A and D genome. The findings showed here will help to understand the composition, structure, and evolution of cotton genome, and contribute to the further perfection of the draft genomes of cotton.", "This movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

The score subtly and powerfully enhances the emotional intensity of the film, capturing the essence of its core themes and leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. The ensemble cast delivers powerhouse performances, effortlessly breathing life into each unique character. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, blending their individual strengths and vulnerabilities to create truly memorable moments. The dialogue is sharp and witty, flowing seamlessly between characters as they navigate the twists and turns of the plot.

It's a testament to the power of storytelling, proving that even the most confusing beginnings can flourish into some of the best films in recent memory. In conclusion, this movie was absolutely worth the patience required to navigate its initial confusion.

Online pirates have unveiled nearly half of the show's next season, which is scheduled to debut its first episode tonight. The episodes began appearing on torrent download sites on Saturday night, and are thought to have leaked from review copies given to the press. Fans of the show, which follows the ambitions and betrayals of competing noble factions and families in the fantasy world of Westeros, now face the daunting task of avoiding spoilers online as the first four episodes are released over the course of the month. Scroll down for video . Game of Thrones, which includes characters such as Emilia Clarke's Khaleesi (left) and Nathalie Emmanuel's Missandei (right), was pirated before its season five debut tonight . Episodes beginning this year's season are titled The Wars to Come, The House of Black and White, High Sparrow and The Sons of the Harpy. They had been downloaded more than 550,000 times as of early Sunday morning, Variety reported, citing the piracy-tracking company Excipio. 'Sadly, it seems the leaked four episodes of the upcoming season of Game of Thrones originated from within a group approved by HBO to receive them. We're actively assessing how this breach occurred,' HBO said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. The series is the most illegally downloaded program in the world. Anti-piracy company Irdeto said that episodes from Game of Thrones's first four seasons were illegally downloaded more than seven million times between February and April 2015. The astounding figure is a 45 per cent jump over the same period from 2014 for the show, which debuted in 2011.

But in fact sandwiches and pasta salads can contain more fat, calories and sugar than burgers and pizzas. Some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of McDonald's, Burger King and Pizza Express, researchers have found. Scroll down for video . Some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of McDonald's, Burger King and Pizza Express, researchers have found . For example, Asda's Piri Piri Chicken Pasta Salad contains 46.5g of fat - two thirds of the recommended daily intake for an adult - which is more than the 43.3g found in a Burger King Bacon and Cheese Whopper. Meanwhile a Marks Spencer Chicken and Smoked Bacon Salad sandwich contains 694 calories and 37.1g of fat - but a Pizza Express Classic Margherita pizza has 683 calories and contains only 22.5g of fat. And a 624-calorie Brie and Bacon Panini from Caffe Nero comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518-calorie McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Consumer group Which?, which conducted the research, said it was surprised to find that three of the sandwiches it surveyed contained more than three teaspoons of sugar. These included Pret's Posh Cheddar and Pickle on Artisan, which contains 17.6g of sugar - equivalent to more than four teaspoons. Which? added it was easy for customers to overeat at lunchtime, with dishes such as Morrisons' Tomato and Basil Chicken Pasta, which states it contains seven servings, often eaten by one person - meaning they consume 683 calories and 38.6g of fat in one sitting. This is more than Burger King's Chicken Royale with Cheese, which has 648 calories and 37.2g of fat. Which? said its research proves all food suppliers need to adopt the traffic light labelling system, which flags up levels of calories, fat, sugar and salt, to help consumers cut through the confusion and find healthy lunch options. A 624-calorie Brie and Bacon Panini from Caffe Nero comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518-calorie McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese . The system is voluntary and many stores opt not to use it. A Which? spokesman said: 'We've uncovered sandwiches and salads that contain more calories and fat than a Big Mac. 'Given our research, it's perhaps not surprising that two thirds of UK adults and a third of children are classed as overweight or obese. Overconsumption of foods high in calories, sugar and fat is fuelling our obesity crisis.'", "Kevin Spacey among celebrities who've paid to get '.sucks' domains removed Several celebrities, including renowned actor Kevin Spacey, have paid substantial amounts of money to have their names removed from so-called .\"sucks\" domains. It is said that these domains were created by Vox Populi Registry Ltd., which gained the right to administer .\"sucks\" websites last year from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This move allows the company to have control over the distribution of the aforementioned domains. Major companies such as YouTube, Bing, Visa, Bank of America, and Yahoo were also reportedly among the targeted parties. As a result, a US regulator is now investigating whether the actions of Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. Vox Populi Registry Ltd. has been encouraging owners of various domain names to resell these .\"sucks\" domains for approximately 2,499 per year. While there were some few who took advantage of the opportunity, it has been met with criticism and negativity from the targeted celebrities, entrepreneurs, and major companies. It is important to note that buying the right to a domain name does not mean one has control over the content of that particular domain. However, owning a domain name can prevent others from using it for defaming, vulgar, and slanderous purposes. The US regulator's investigation is expected to determine whether Vox Populi Registry Ltd's actions were illegal or not.

However, his latest movie, \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood,\" has brought my faith back in him as a brilliant filmmaker. Set against the backdrop of 1969 Hollywood, the film follows the story of an actor, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is trying to stay relevant, and his stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), as they navigate this changing landscape. The movie is an incredible love letter to cinema itself, with larger-than-life characters, compelling dialogues, and classic soundtrack to keep you engaged. Tarantino's unique storytelling style is much more evident in this film, with each scene gracefully building the tension leading up to the climax. What makes \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" stand out, are the remarkable performances by the star-studded cast. DiCaprio and Pitt showcase their incredible talent and chemistry throughout the film, making it a pleasure to see their characters build a strong bond. Margot Robbie brings the perfect balance of innocence and nostalgia as Sharon Tate, while the supporting cast, including Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, and Bruce Dern create a sense of immersion in the era. The movie's climax is classic Tarantino - shocking, brutal, and darkly humorous. It ties the entire film together, giving a satisfying, yet thought-provoking conclusion, making you question the reality of fame and the price that comes with it. In conclusion, \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" is a must-watch for Tarantino fans and cinema lovers alike. It's a masterful pastiche of old Hollywood that balances dark comedy, action, and drama in the inimitable Tarantino way. This film has definitely restored my faith in the director and makes me eagerly anticipate his next project.", "Fired:Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10, low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers.

Person1: That's not my concern. I live on my own so I'm only looking for a cheap single room, something like a flat. Person2: Umm, that may be a problem here in this area then, because there are mostly larger houses here. You'd probably be able to share one with other people who want to rent though. Person1: No, I'm only interested in flats at the moment. Person2: We actually have another office in South Derby, and the guy who works there is a really good friend of mine.

Thanks for your help.", "Taut, topical political thriller, taking square aim at the controversial US policy of rendition, another appalling Orwell-ian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?). \"Rendition Unraveled\" delves deep into the murky waters of state-sanctioned abduction and torture, shedding a much-needed light on the unethical practices that have remained a stain on the US government's human rights record. The movie follows the story of Hakim (played by the brilliant Idris Elba), an earnest family man wrongfully accused of terrorism. The well-paced, intricate plot takes the audience through a whirlwind of suspense and heart-wrenching emotion, portraying a raw, unapologetic image of the bureaucratic nightmare that is the extraordinary rendition policy. The timely screenplay by award-winning writer Jane Thompson explores the government's complicity in perpetrating human rights abuses often overlooked in mainstream media. The director, David Fincher, successfully tackles the delicate balance between maintaining narrative tension alongside this important political thought-piece. Elba's portrayal of the undeniably likable Hakim creates an emotional connection with the audience, ultimately humanizing a phenomenon that is, regrettably, all too common. Supporting actor Edward Norton delivers a top-notch performance as the conflicted CIA agent Damon, who wrestles with obedience to authority and moral obligation to the injustices inflicted upon Hakim. The powerful cinematography and deft editing transport the audience between suburban American life and the dark, secretive black sites, where interrogations and torture take place. This contrast amplifies the movie's key message - that the fight against terrorism should remain within the bounds of moral integrity and human rights. In sum, \"Rendition Unraveled\" is a riveting, hard-hitting political thriller that does not shy away from exposing the brutal truths of US policy. With powerhouse performances, a gripping plot, and an important social message, this film demands attention and discussion long after the credits roll. A must-watch for fans of political thrillers and conscientious citizens alike.", "A way to reduce detrimental effects of deep-fat frying is through operating-pressure reduction, the essence behind vacuum deep-fat frying. In this way, it is possible to remove product moisture at a low temperature in a low-oxygen environment. The objective of this research was to study the effect of oil temperature reduction when vacuum frying traditional (potatoes) and nontraditional products (carrots and apples) on most important quality attributes (vitamins, color, and oil uptake). Results are promising and show that vacuum frying can be an alternative to produce nutritious and novel snacks with desired quality attributes, since vitamins and color were greatly preserved and oil absorption could be substantially reduced.", "Person1: Well, I'll see you later, Mrs. Todd.

A potential source of psychosocial symptoms may be the subjective responses to experience of chronic pain due to the subjective meanings of pain. Implications for Rehabilitation About chronic pain Pain is an experience, not only an aversive sensation. Intensity of pain describes only the sensation, not the experience of pain. In chronic pain, the main complaint may be not the physical pain, but the distress. In rehabilitation, the patient needs to be taken as a whole person.

Hundreds of patrons hoping for an iced daiquiri at the debut of a Fat Tuesdays bar inside the Resort World Casino ended up at each other's throats when the party went sour. According to a casino worker, the fighting goes back to two women who clashed during the long wait for alcohol, dragging their group of friends into the conflict. Scroll down for video . Chairs in the air: An enormous fight broke out at a bar opening at Resorts World casino in Queens, New York . Bar brawl: Video posted on twitter showed angry patrons attacking one another . The fisticuffs escalated, with guests grabbing chairs and poles to bring to the fray, as security guards rushed in to try to calm the brawlers down. Bystanders uploaded cell phone footage of the ugly brawl, which broke out around 10.30pm, to social media. Running gangs of fighters can be seen storming through the halls of the casino, shouting profanities at one another. A witness, Elize Brown, told CBS2 New York: 'It was chairs flying everywhere - it was chaotic. 'It was nerve-wracking. It was like you don't know what the next thing that was going to happen was.' According to the New York Post, three men were arrested in the aftermath of the brawl, which injured four security guards and a police officer. Andrew Rivers and Jovan Bovell, both 23, were charged with disorderly conduct. Fists flying: Huge crowds of people went at one another using their fists, or even casino props, to hurt one another .

The Italian side has not been able to secure a win on the road in the last five months, with their last away victory dating back to November 2. Udinese, who are currently facing the danger of relegation, are also under immense pressure to up their performance after suffering a loss at the hands of Parma recently. Udinese has a less-than-impressive home record, having only won a single game out of their last nine home matches. As both teams battle it out to avoid slipping further down the league table, the match promises to be a tense and closely-fought encounter between these two beleaguered clubs. Palermo's managerial staff and players, including Vitiello, will be working tirelessly to turn the tide in their favor and salvage their away reputation. It's not just about individual performances; both teams will need to rise above their weaknesses and showcase their strengths and potential in this crucial game. This highly anticipated match will be a true test of determination, skill, and teamwork for both Palermo and Udinese. In the face of these challenges, fans and followers of Italian football can expect a nail-biting and evenly-matched game with enormous stakes for both teams. The upcoming match may be the turning point for Palermo and Udinese, offering a chance for redemption and a crucial step towards securing their position in the league. No matter what the outcome, this match will undoubtedly go down in the annals of Italian football as a fiercely contested and memorable battle.", "The structural similarity of hATPase and bATPase and the sequence similarity within the Hsp70 chaperone family suggest a universal mechanism of ATP hydrolysis among all Hsp70 molecular chaperones. Two calcium ions have been found in the hATPase structure. One corresponds to the magnesium site in bATPase and appears to be important for ATP hydrolysis and in vitro phosphorylation. Local changes in protein structure as a result of calcium binding may facilitate phosphorylation. A small, but significant, movement of metal ions and sidechains could position catalytically important threonine residues for phosphorylation. The second calcium site represents a new calcium-binding motif that can play a role in the stabilization of protein structure.

The couple, whose names have not been released, were described by witnesses as having just arrived at the supermarket to do their grocery shopping when the tragic accident occurred. A distressed bystander described the scene, stating that the woman was \"covered in blood\" as her husband rushed to her side. \"It was a shocking sight. The poor woman was lying on the ground and there was blood everywhere,\" the eyewitness recalled. In a moving display of compassion, a Tesco worker held the injured woman in her arms while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. The worker was reportedly attempting to comfort the woman, repeatedly telling her, \"We're here for you; help is on the way.\" Upon their arrival, paramedics treated the woman at the scene before transporting her to a nearby hospital for further treatment. The woman's condition remains critical, and she has been placed in an induced coma to aid in her recovery. Police at the scene conducted a standard breathalyzer test on the driver, but no arrest has been made. A spokesperson for the police department confirmed that the incident is being treated as a \"tragic accident,\" and they are not seeking any further legal action against the husband. The police also assured the public that the case will be thoroughly investigated to determine the exact circumstances leading up to the accident. The Tesco store was temporarily closed for several hours following the incident, but has since reopened to shoppers. Store management has expressed their deepest condolences to the couple and their family, stating that their thoughts are with them during this difficult time.

The attention to detail in setting and costumes creates an immersive experience that fans of history and sports alike will appreciate.

His portrayal is both captivating and terrifying, as viewers get the chance to peel back the layers of Cobb's complicated personality. The supporting cast is equally exceptional, with standout performances by Jane Smith as his long-suffering wife, and John Johnson as his equally compulsive and competitive rival. \"The Georgia Peach: The Ty Cobb Story\" is not without its flaws, however. At times, the pacing can feel rushed, and some aspects of the plot may lean too heavily on artistic license. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall experience remains a thrilling ride through the world of baseball at the height of Ty Cobb's career. In conclusion, this sports biopic offers a fascinating exploration into the life of one of the most controversial yet outstanding athletes in baseball history. With stellar performances and action-packed baseball sequences, viewers will be mesmerized by the story of Ty Cobb. \"The Georgia Peach: The Ty Cobb Story\" is a must-see for baseball enthusiasts and cinephiles alike.", "Person1: My favorite course is definitely the Creative Writing class. It allows me to express my ideas and improve my writing skills.", "The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along. Maybe it's just me though, but I think poor Lazarus should've had his story focused on more. He's a hurting man after his wife leaves him, but we never fully see how helping Rae resolve her past pains heals him too. It's just implied that it doesin essence, he plays the wizard that helps the young Rae overcome her curse, through a big ol' chain and some blues.I like the story, but I wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational. The side characters were fairly decent, if simple and I liked the music. The acting was good enough, although I can't be certain if the Rae character is fully believable. But that might just be my naivety.All in all, I liked the film, but I wasn't compelled by it. Maybe it's that I'm too critical, but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so, while it all seemed very cool, I could never truly buy it. The chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. Still, this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues. 710", "We propose a revised model of developmental programming reconciling the male and female observations, in which there are two competing programmes which collectively drive liver transcription. The first element is a thrifty metabolic phenotype induced by early life growth restriction independently of leptin levels. The second is a homeostatic set point calibrated in response to postnatal leptin surge, which is able to over-ride the metabolic programme. This \"calibration model\" for the postnatal leptin surge, if applicable in humans, may have implications for understanding responses to catch-up growth in infants.

However, two of the positions modified on C. elegans snRNAs are unique, one at position 28 on U2 snRNA and one at position 62 on U4 snRNA.

This series lacks any semblance of a plotline, character development, or substance. The actors seemed disinterested and disconnected from their roles, while the stale dialogue left me cringing and bored. The special effects were laughably cheap, making it almost impossible to suspend disbelief and immerse myself in the world the creators were trying to establish. The humor fell flat and often bordered on offensive, making me question how this show managed to accumulate a fan base in the first place. A relentless parade of tropes, cliches, and worn-out concepts, this series is a testament to the lows of television entertainment. It's baffling to see such a wasted opportunity when so many shows manage to present intelligent, original, and engaging content. In conclusion, this show is a disappointing and uninspired addition to the vast realm of series available. I'm typically one to find merit in creative endeavors, but this show represents a new low for the television industry. The only positive thing I can say is that watching this show really makes me appreciate the quality of other shows that much more.", "Person1: Oh, I see. Thanks for pointing that out, Alice. So, do I just put my clothes in the washing machine and then transfer them to the dryer when they're done? Person2: That's right! First, you'll need to separate your clothes into whites, light colors, and dark colors. Each pile should go into a different washing machine. You'll also need to add detergent before you start the cycle. Person1: Got it. How much detergent should I use, and in which compartment does it go? Person2: It's usually best to follow the instructions on the detergent bottle. For these machines, you can pour the detergent directly into the drum with your clothes. But don't use too much, or else your clothes might not rinse properly. Person1: Good to know. And what about the settings on the washing machine? Person2: Typically, you'll want to use the normal setting for most of your clothes. If you have delicate items, you may want to use the delicate setting. Just make sure to check the labels on your clothes for any special washing instructions. Person1: Perfect. And once the washing is done, what's the process for drying the clothes? Person2: When the washing cycle is done, remove your clothes from the washing machine and put them into one of the large dryers. It's a good idea to clean the lint filter before you start the dryer. Then, choose the appropriate setting - usually the regular or medium heat setting will work well for most clothes. You might want to check on them periodically to make sure they don't over-dry.

The only positive thing I can say about it is that Luke Perry gave a good performance. But unfortunately, not even his acting skills could save this train wreck of a film. The plot was so convoluted and full of unnecessary twists that it was impossible to follow or even remotely care about the fate of these characters. The dialogue felt forced and unnatural, making it difficult to relate to any of the characters or even root for our hero. The special effects were embarrassingly outdated, and the film's attempt at being edgy and daring resulted in cringe-worthy moments that made me want to hide my face until it was over. As for the pacing, it was beyond inconsistent. Just when I thought the movie was going to gain momentum and become exciting, it slowed down to a painful crawl that made me question whether I could sit through the rest of it. However, I must give credit where it's due, Luke Perry tried his best to shine through the murky mess of this film, and despite the terrible material he had to work with, managed to deliver a convincing and heartfelt performance. It's such a shame that his talents were wasted on such a dreadful film. In conclusion, the only reason I sat through this horrendous movie was for the hope that Luke Perry's performance would somehow redeem it. Unfortunately, that was not the case, so save yourself the time and skip this tedious cinematic disaster.", "Person1: Yes, actually. I seem to be a bit lost.

Some studies suggest that this surgical approach may provide satisfactory outcomes for patients with complex distal humerus fractures, but further research is needed to compare this approach with other surgical techniques and treatment modalities. A study conducted by Huang et al. (2018) assessed the clinical outcomes of using the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach in combination with double precontoured locking plate fixation to treat Orthopaedic Trauma Association type C distal humerus fractures. The results of this study indicated that the procedure produced favorable outcomes, with a low complication rate and good functional recovery. However, this conclusion is limited by the small sample size of the study, and more extensive research studies are needed to evaluate the true efficiency of this approach. It's also important to note that the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach may not be suitable for all patients, and individual factors such as age, overall health, and the complexity of the fracture should be considered when determining the appropriate treatment strategy. An individualized assessment of each patient is necessary, ideally involving multidisciplinary teams of experienced orthopedic surgeons and medical professionals. In conclusion, the existing literature on the efficiency of the triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle approach with double precontoured locking plate fixation for the treatment of Orthopaedic Trauma Association type C distal humerus fractures is limited. Further research is required to definitively establish the effectiveness of this procedure in comparison to alternative treatment strategies.", "This soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. 'Cleansing Lies' is a prime example of what not to do when creating a movie. The film follows the tangled web of deception in the world of high-stakes soap making; however, the real atrocity lies in the film's baseless plot that slowly chips away at the viewer's sanity. The writing feels as if it was mindlessly slapped together. Every predictable twist and forced subplot are like cogs in a machine specifically designed to aggravate the audience. The over-the-top dramatics of the protagonists and their never-ending back and forth would have you believe they were showcasing their talents for a high school drama club. As if the lackluster writing wasn't enough, the acting reeks of mediocrity. The lead, played by Aiden Stumbleson, could easily be mistaken for a lifeless cardboard cutout. Meanwhile, other cast members chime in with theatrical performances reminiscent of 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. The lack of on-screen chemistry amongst the actors effectively dulls what little excitement the narrative could muster. Not even the film's cinematography can save this ship from sinking. An abundance of soap opera-like zooms and an overuse of slow-motion create a whirlpool of melodramatic nausea that even the most dedicated viewer would struggle to endure. To say the movie defies logic would be too kind. It tramples on the very concept of a coherent narrative and grinds it into an abhorrent concoction that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. However, 'Cleansing Lies' won't just leave you with a subpar viewing experience; it'll leave you with a lingering annoyance that precious minutes of your life were wasted. If there's a silver lining in 'Cleansing Lies,' it's that it serves as an epitome of the bare minimum a film could achieve. The film's greatest achievement is making one wonder if a group of people intentionally ruined every aspect of filmmaking.

Carrick, 33, has played a pivotal role for United this season, and has drawn praise from van Gaal for his displays in the heart of the team's midfield. However, with age catching up to Carrick, the Red Devils are eager to find a suitable replacement to ensure a smooth transition, and Dortmund's Gundogan appears to be the top choice. Gundogan, who has been with Borussia Dortmund since 2011, has shown great versatility and composure in his midfield role, and has drawn comparisons to Carrick because of his ability to dictate the flow of the game. Van Gaal has been monitoring Gundogan's progress closely and is reportedly convinced that the German can replicate Carrick's displays at Old Trafford. United are expected to face stiff competition from the likes of Barcelona and Manchester City for Gundogan's signature, as the player has attracted interest from various top clubs across Europe. Dortmund, who recently confirmed the departure of club captain Mats Hummels to Bayern Munich, will be keen on holding onto Gundogan, who is contracted to the club until June 2017. However, it is believed that a significant offer could tempt the German outfit into a sale. It remains to be seen whether United can secure Gundogan's services in the transfer window, but the player's potential arrival at Old Trafford would certainly boost the club's midfield options, and help the team to replicate the dominance they enjoyed with Carrick in peak form.", "Person1: Hey there! I've been hoping to run into you. Are you busy tomorrow morning? Person2: Let me see. . . Wednesday morning. Yes, I am booked solid all morning. What's up? Person1: I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year. I'm having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me. It has a lot of complicated form Person2: I can explain them to you. It'll just take about a half an hour. How about Friday afternoon? Person1: Ooh. Sorry, that's not good for me. I am tied up all day Friday. We'll have to do it next week. I am wide open then. Person2: OK. Shall we say next week, on Tuesday at 2:30? Person1: Sure, that'll be fine for me. I'll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros.", "Person1: Thank you for showing me your offices, Mr. Becker. I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs. Person2: Why do you say that? Person1: The city is beautiful, the off . . . , the offices are modern and comfortable, and the work is so interesting. Person2: Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives. Government service can be a rewarding and secure career. Person1: Do you mean financially rewarding? Person2: Well, many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries. Person1: I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy. Person2: Sometimes that's true, but not usually. Most feds are honest, hard-working professionals. It's hard to keep highly trained people, so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive. Person1: How much do you make? Person2: I'm a GS-15. That's high on the scale of workers, but even a GS-1 is paid a living wage.", "I checked out this video expecting to like it. Wanting to like it. I like foreign films, I like beautiful cinematography, I know the critics liked this film (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I don't mind \"slow\" films.Well, it's beautiful. That's about the best I can say for it. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the glances are very meaningful, the actors are very sincere, and it seems like a very long movie. I fell asleep half way though it, woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. It was a trial, but I made it to the end. I didn't like it any better for that.", "I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. As someone who was just discovering the magic of music, this movie enamored me from the very beginning. The true-life story of Buddy Holly, a pioneer of rock 'n' roll, is brilliantly told in this 1978 biopic directed by Steve Rash. Gary Busey's Oscar-nominated performance as the charismatic Buddy Holly is nothing short of amazing. He brings to life the unique blend of talent, ambition, and passion that Holly embodied, while also showcasing his remarkable ability to believably lip-sync and play the guitar. In addition, the supporting cast members, such as Charles Martin Smith as Ray Bob Simmons and Don Stroud as drummer Jesse Charles, perfectly complement Busey's star performance. The film's pacing is just right, embarking on Buddy Holly's journey from humble beginnings in Lubbock, Texas, to the heights of fame and ultimately, his untimely and tragic death at just 22. What sets this film apart is its unflinching portrayal of the racial tensions and industry challenges of the time, never shying away from the harsh realities of the 1950s music scene. The soundtrack is an absolute treat for music lovers, featuring lively renditions of iconic hits such as \"That'll Be the Day\" and \"Peggy Sue.\" It's impossible not to tap your feet or sing along as the film progresses, fully immersing you in the revolutionary spirit of early rock 'n' roll. In conclusion, The Buddy Holly Story is a timeless tribute to a gifted musician whose impact continues to resonate throughout the world of music. It is not only entertaining but also serves as an insightful snapshot of an era that helped shape modern pop culture. To this day, it remains one of my favorite films, appealing to both the music enthusiast in me and the nostalgic element of watching it together with my family as a young child.", "If you need a clue as to whether Playmaker is decent or not, look to its star, Colin Firth, who refers to it in an interview as \"absolute rubbish I sincerely hope no one ever sees it.\"The script and plot are ludicrous, the female lead is unconvincing. The only thing worthwhile is Colin Firth, and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout.For diehard Firth fans only the shower scene alone is worth the 3.99 you might have to shell out, should you find it in a video cutout bin like I did.I'm happy for Mr. Firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over!", "Person1: Kate, you never believe what's happened. Person2: What do you mean? Person1: Masha and Hero are getting divorced. Person2: You are kidding. What happened? Person1: Well, I don't really know, but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months, and filed for divorce. Person2: That's really surprising. I always thought they are well matched. What about the kids? Who get custody? Person1: Masha, it seems quiet and makable, no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out. Person2: That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about. Well, I still can't believe it, Masha and Hero, the perfect couple. When would they divorce be final? Person1: Early in the New Year I guess.", "Well, for this abomination of a film, I wasn't expecting anything good. In fact, it was so laughably terrible that it reached a level of entertainment that a proper film never could. From the horrendous acting, barely-existent plot, and incredibly poor production value, this movie was a train wreck right from the start. The storyline was filled with cliches and predictability that left me cringing more often than not. The filmmakers' idea of plot twists seemed to include convenient occurrences that in no way made any sense whatsoever. The actor's performances were wooden and forced, leaving me to wonder who thought they were a good fit for their respective roles in this disaster. The production quality of this film was the cherry on top of a horrendous cake. The shoddy camerawork often went out of focus, and the CGI looked like it was conjured up from a 90s video game. The audio was so inconsistent that it was hard to understand what the actors were even saying half the time. However, perhaps the saving grace of this abomination was the unintentional hilarity it produced. Every disaster unfolding on screen had me chuckling in disbelief as the film somehow managed to sink lower and lower. This might just be the perfect pick for a group of friends looking to have a good laugh at the expense of a truly terrible movie. In conclusion, this film is a prime example of what not to do when making a movie. Nothing was done right, and it was a pure embarrassment to the art of filmmaking. Watch this movie if you dare, but be prepared for a cringe-worthy experience that may leave you crying with laughter.", "As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel like I can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward. The movie \"Forever Strong\" paints a very realistic picture of the grit, determination, and camaraderie necessary for a successful rugby team. The film not only showcases the physical demands of the sport but also delves into the emotional journey of its characters. Director Ryan Little's execution of the sports scenes is truly commendable as they are not only exciting and fast-paced but also meticulously arranged. The actors showcase incredible athleticism and their passion for the game, making it a treat for any Highland Rugby fan. The lead character, Rick Penning, played by Sean Faris, undergoes a compelling transformation in the film. His character's growth, from a brash and arrogant young man to a more responsible and grounded individual, is effectively portrayed. In addition, Gary Cole, as Coach Larry Gelwix, delivers a stellar performance, showcasing the unique coaching style and principles that have made HR a successful rugby powerhouse. The movie touches upon the themes of teamwork, self-growth, and accountability. Although at times it strays into the territory of cliches, it never loses sight of its true message of perseverance and changing for the better. The powerful bond between teammates is endearing, which forms the emotional core of the film. The cinematography captures the intensity and speed of the sport, making the rugby scenes immersive and thrilling. The high-quality visuals, combined with the invigorating soundtrack, help convey the sense of competition and victory that Highland Rugby is known for. \"Forever Strong\" is a must-watch film for not only rugby fans but also those who appreciate a gripping, character-driven sports story. It not only leaves you at the edge of your seat cheering for the team but also teaches you valuable life lessons. In conclusion, this film does a wonderful job of showcasing the true spirit of Highland Rugby and accurately represents the HR community that has shaped the lives of so many young men.", "Spoilers ahead.2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused. Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over. It is a film that you could meditate on. The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer, it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part) the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past. We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation. An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence. Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development. On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered. The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission. Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all of the traits of human beings. The film has many outstanding sequences. As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding. Most memorable are \"Blue Danube\" and \"Also Spake Zarathustra\" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.) The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life. The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis. In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well. The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution. The architecture of the film is also meaningful. The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie. The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine. It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope. This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth. In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much. Hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one. But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it. The process of making this film used all of his creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence. 2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience. Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.", "Person1: You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that. Person2: What makes you say that? Person1: I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing! That's just the problem. In these kind of things, the trouble doesn't always appear at first. Person2: But everything has been so easy. Person1: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, but if you were to do it, you would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that. Person2: Yeah, you never look at the positive side of things. Person1: Okay. Have it your way, but don't say I didn't warn you.", "Before going any further, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had the time, I might have considered watching it every week, if only to see how the season played out. However, it was very clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of \"The Apprentice\" just doesn't \"fit in.\" Martha Stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker, a domestic diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Sure, she was compelling for a while, and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does she have to come off as cold and tough? Shouldn't she?But the truth was, by the time Stewart came out of prison, her attempts for a public comeback, though certainly warranted, were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long. Perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once, the other being her syndicated daytime series Martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at her peak Stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask that American audiences immediately accept her foray into reality TV. Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it.The show was basically a tired retread of Trump's \"Apprentice,\" which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks, the cast, and Trump's firing decisions (often controversial - likely for that reason). The letter bit was certainly not cliche but obnoxious in the least. The fact that Stewart never says, \"You're fired!\" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for dealing with Stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman. Again never mainstream, Stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic \"toughness\" of Donald Trump. Yes, this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character, but I mean it to be more about the nature of her business.It comes as no shock that Stewart has been fired, but I wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season?", "Yes, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy has been shown to correlate with catalepsy and the suppression of conditioned avoidance response behavior in rats. Many studies have investigated the role of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in antipsychotic drug effects and have found that it significantly contributes to the suppression of certain behaviors, such as conditioned avoidance response. In these studies, rats are typically given different doses of antipsychotic drugs, which cause varying levels of D2 receptor occupancy. It has been observed that higher levels of receptor occupancy are more likely to result in cataleptic behavior and suppression of conditioned avoidance responses. These findings suggest that D2 receptor occupancy may be an important factor in understanding the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. Further research is needed to fully understand the role D2 receptor occupancy plays in the therapeutic effects of these drugs and to optimize their usage in treating disorders such as schizophrenia.", "Tim Howard joined Everton in the Community's Medicash powered wheelchair football team for a training session at Croxteth Sports Centre last week.

The England midfielder has interest from Liverpool with Brendan Rodgers keen to fill the vacuum created by Steven Gerrard's departure. However, Milner is frustrated by reports suggesting that he has already outlined a move to Anfield. While City head into Sunday's Manchester derby trailing neighbours United in the league for first time since November 2013, Milner is keen to ensure that City finish the season as strongly as possible. Manchester City midfielder James Milner will make a decision over his future at the end of the season . Milner, pictured after Manchester City's 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace, is weighing up his options . His present deal expires in June and his future has been clouded in uncertainty since contract negotiations reached deadlock in December. Only last month, manager Manuel Pellegrini described him as a 'phenomenon' and English football's 'most complete player' in a clear attempt to persuade him to stay at the Etihad. 'Milner is a phenomenon, a guy with big balls and a heart this big,' said Pellegrini. 'I hope he stays. If he doesn't, it will be because there's an important offer [from elsewhere].' Milner though has made just 13 Premier League starts from 31 games - less than Jesus Navas, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri, Fernandinho and Fernando - and wants more regular football. Brendan Rodgers is keen for Milner, pictured in 2012, to help fill the void left by the outgoing Steven Gerrard . Liverpool began their pursuit of Milner almost 12 months ago and a move to Merseyside would tick many boxes. Milner would not have to uproot his young family from their home in Hale and would be offered the chance to play in his favoured central midfield position. As a free transfer, he will command a deal that matches or exceeds his current 120,000 a week salary at City. Arsenal and Everton have also expressed interest while Inter Milan, Roma and Valencia are also in the race for his signature. Milner will not make a firm choice though until after City's final game of the campaign against Southampton for what could be the last major contract of his career.", "Person1: Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?

Person1: Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit? Person2: Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit. Person1: Hmm.

The cytoplasm source had a significant effect on grain weight across the two experimental locations. There was also a significant cytoplasmic effect on filled-grain ratio, but only in two of three nuclear background and at one of the two locations. The results extend our previous findings with japonica rice, suggesting that the selection of appropriate cytoplasmic germplasm is broadly important in rice breeding, and that cytoplasmic effects on some traits, such as filled-grain ratio, cannot be generalized; effects should be evaluated in the nuclear backgrounds of interest and at multiple locations.", "As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underrated), I have to boo this movie. \"Whispers in a Hectic World\" had the potential to be a powerful drama, but unfortunately, it falls incredibly short. Barkin's raw talent is the only shining light in this poorly executed film. The writing is lackluster, with clunky dialogue and a convoluted plot that leaves the audience more frustrated than enthralled. The direction of the film is sloppy, with abrupt changes in tone and subplots that seem to fizzle out without any resolution. The supporting cast, though talented in their own right, is underutilized and overshadowed by Barkin's presence. It seems as if the filmmakers were unsure whether to focus on the central character's emotional journey or the superficial political intrigue that was woven in and out of the narrative. The film's technical aspects, such as cinematography and sound editing, are decent but fail to elevate the movie from its shortcomings. You can only appreciate the gorgeous shots of the cityscape for so long before realizing that the visuals cannot compensate for the weak storyline. Overall, \"Whispers in a Hectic World\" is a disappointing effort that wastes the talents of the amazing Ellen Barkin. The film's creators left a lot of potential on the table and did little to capitalize on the powerful themes that could have made this a memorable and poignant movie. In the end, the audience is left longing for a more cohesive and engaging film that could have made better use of Barkin's incredible acting abilities.", "I really like the movie's opening, when Col. Ted Masters realizes on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 o'clock. The good news is that the movie does not mention at the very beginning that the colonel, along with a wingman fighter who was a lieutenant, was trying to do a \"freedom of navigation\" exercise along the eastern Meditteranean Sea, but went a little too past the restricted air space zone reserved for a rogue Middle eastern nation as they accidentially fly past it.I also like all of the intercutting on the colonel's fighter radar readouts and computer displays as the enemy aircraft aggressively picks the two American fighter pilots into an engagement for violating their airspace. That first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie, \"Top Gun.\" From the waxing of the enemy bandits to the enemy aircraft's thirty-milimeter rounds that struck the colonel's jet engines and forcing the plane down, forcing him to eject, all of this reminds us of one thing...dogfight fighter techniques can keep you alive...but one false move can cause you to be shot down.The only problem in the movie was the \"snake sequence\" scene. It was a little bit too long. Yes, the movie's opening was great when you see the conflict...which was the dogfight engagement. Only when one boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the \"snake\" race, forces us back to the time the conflict already started. I guess the snake sequence in the middle should be interrupted a little bit by Col. Masters being dragged in handcuffs in the middle of the Bilyad desert on his way to the detention center...while the music sequence for the \"snake\" continues. The film does not do it...if it were, the conflict's details would have been smoother at that point. Still good otherwise.When word found out that Col. Ted Masters trial for high treason (violating territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was condemned to be hung on the gallows in three days, Doug Masters decides to go into action. With the Air Force having futile attempts to save the man, Doug decides to pull his friends and Col. Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for a plan to rescue Masters. Risking a high chance of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military stockade, he goes against Air Force policy and makes a plan to rescue Masters without consent of the U.S. government.Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get plenty of stuff on the area where Masters is held for the upcoming hanging, and the surrounding area around Bilyad (which turns out to be a fake Middle Eastern country for the movie). One plan included shooting off firecrackers outside the Air Force darkroom area as a diversion to get classified photos and maintenance stuff on the fighter aircraft, fighter base, intelligence, and all of the other military stuff around Bilyad. When all was said and done, and Sinclair studied all of the intelligence, he almost rebuffed at that plan because Doug was way too cocky. Not until they get the two F-16 planes and tried a dry run across a firing range that I realized what they were going to do overseas. I realized that Doug's fighter shooting and bomb dropping is not good until he hears rock music. I can remember when he dropped one Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet....I realized that Doug is unusual. He likes music when he fires the fighter ammunition.The last part of the conflict, the final dogfight action in \"Iron Eagle\" was better than Top Gun's climax of the hostile dogfight sequences. I liked the way the final conflict unfolded, especially when Doug Masters faces off with an Middle-Eastern ace fighter pilot who actually ran the trial against Ted Masters. Short but sweet when Doug took the enemy fighter out after a second try by a side-winder missile. Looks like this Bilyad colonel was akin to \"Darth Vader\" in Star Wars....in the air, he can be very evil, because if you have seen Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was an ace pilot in space. Unusual connotation for this but still works!", "By virtue of network motifs, we basically solved the open question about 'party hubs' and 'date hubs' which was raised by previous studies. Specifically, at the level of network motifs instead of individual proteins, we found two types of hubs, motif party hubs (mPHs) and motif date hubs (mDHs), whose network motifs display distinct characteristics on biological functions. In addition, in this paper we studied network motifs from a different viewpoint. That is, we show that a network motif should not be merely considered as an interaction pattern but be considered as an essential function unit in organizing modules of networks.", "Person1: Really?

No significant dose response relationship between D90 and PSA was found in the intermediate and high-risk population of patients. This could be due to (1) the presence of oedema or discrepancy between pre- and post-implant volumes causing a low D90, (2) the possibility that the underdosed area could be situated where there is unlikely to be tumour, (3) the fact that biochemical control does not equate to local control because some patients fail outside the prostate, particularly in the high and intermediate risk patients, (4) if D90 is a good discriminator only for low risk patients, the absence of a dose response correlation in this series which contained 53.8 intermediate and high risk patients could be related to case mix.", "Lynne Abraham, 74, experienced a momentary drop in blood pressure, causing her to collapse during a recent mayoral debate.

(1) Outcomes research in continuing medical education suggests the need for ongoing reinforcement, which we do structurally through the three-session model. (2) We use a classical microteaching approach to develop insight and self-awareness. Each videotaped encounter is reviewed, stopped at key points, and discussed by the entire group. These discussions commonly open up after the workshop leaders ask questions such as, \"What were you thinking there?\" or \"What were you trying to do?\" or \"What would you ask next?\" (3) We emphasize the importance of knowing-in-action and the related reflection that guides action in practice.

In all honesty, I watched this one out of \"choice-less-ness.\" It is a very big waste of time and money.It seems HK movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world.Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch, rather than something you want us to watch.The graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid-90s low resolution games (in comparison to today's).The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s' Wing Commander game, namely the third installment of the series.

The official refused to comment on how many such satellites there were, and which countries were operating them. It suggests there could be more satellites than thought monitoring different countries on Earth. The claim was made by the commander of Russian Space Command. Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse . The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called 'Space Special Forces' during a tour of Russia's main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. 'Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,' he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes. The film goes on to state that there 'are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.' The comments were made yesterday on 'Space Day', when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space - and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it's not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim. The comments were made yesterday on 'Space Day', when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin (pictured), on 12 April 1961.

Ballance's 122 was the mainstay of England's 333 for seven declared leaving West Indies needing an unlikely 438 to win the first Test. They finished the fourth day on 98 for two after another superb Chris Jordan slip catch made the breakthrough. Gary Ballance scored 122 as England took firm control of the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua . Ballance plays a sweep shot during his impressive innings at theSir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Ballance, who had a poor World Cup , said: 'It's been a tough winter but four bad innings don't make you a bad cricketer. I would like to think I was settled at number three after last summer. Scoring a hundred in a Test match is a great feeling. You have to enjoy doing well,' as his joyous century celebration indicated. Even with the ever-present Pietersen factor Ballance added: 'That's international sport, I haven't doubted my place. I knew I had done well before. I didn't come here thinking that I was going to get dropped. I was focused on scoring runs and to get a hundred is huge.' There needs to be an opening for KP to make a sensational England comeback. But there looks to be no room in the line-up for Pietersen. Ballance at number three followed by Ian Bell and Joe Root seems a rock solid middle order for the Ashes this summer, by when KP will be 35. Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jordan's stunning one-handed catch off part-time bowler Joe Root to dismiss Darren Bravo was a critical moment . Ballance said: 'It was brilliant by CJ but he does it all the time. He's got unbelievable hands.'

The 25-ft long wreckage was discovered floating west of Ona Beach in Lincoln County at about 9.30am on Thursday. Biologists with the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the boat remains and and found 'several live specimens of a variety of yellowtail jack fish found in the coastal waters of Japan.' Tsunami debris: A chunk of a fiberglass boat 25-30' long has been spotted floating off the Oregon shore . Rescued: These live yellowtail jack fish, native to Japan, were found inside the floating debris and are now being housed in the Oregon Coast Aquarium . The several live yellowtail jack fish found on board will be delivered to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes, boats, and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern Japan - were swallowed by the ocean when the tsunami struck four years ago. About 70 per cent of it sank, leaving about 1.5 million tons floating with scientists saying they expect more debris to hit Alaska and the West Coast of North America for years to come. An estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in March of 2011 during the tsunami. Around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the Japanese coast. Some more mobile items may have reached the Pacific Northwest before 2011 even came to a close. The first documented piece of debris to arrive in California, a barnacle covered fishing boat, came ashore in April 2013. The particles are dispersed sparsely from Alaska to the Philippines. In 2013, a floating island of debris the size of Texas crossed the vast Pacific Ocean to the western shores of the Americas. The Oregan authorities plan to tow the boat segment to the Port of Newport for temporary storage. 'The debris appears to be half to two-thirds of a larger vessel, possibly damaged and set adrift during the earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan in 2011,' saidChris Havel of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. He said biologists inspected the object and consulted with the state Fish and Wildlife Department, deciding that the attached organisms pose little threat to the Oregon coast ecosystem. The remains of the boat will eventually be removed from the water, studied, dismantled and taken to a landfill. Wreckage: The fiberglass remains of the boat found floating off the coast of Oregon yesterday . Wreckage:A floating island of debris the size of Texas floated toward California coast in 2013 after washing into the Pacific in Japan's horrific 2011 tsunami . Ghost ship: The 164ft Japanese fishing vessel Ryou-Un Maru entered US waters March 31, 2012, on its ghostly journey after being washed away by the massive wave.

Developing biomarkers for inflammation of the ocular surface will provide improved understanding of the mechanisms leading to DED, classification of the severity of DED, and objective metrics for outcome measures of treatment. The chronicity of the disease suggests that dysregulation of immune mechanisms leads to a cycle of continued inflammation, accompanied by alterations in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Given the underlying mechanism for DED, developing effective and safe anti-inflammatory treatments is likely to be beneficial for patients with DED.", "I cannot get over how awful this movie was. From the moment the opening credits rolled to the much-awaited end, I found myself in a state of perpetual cringe. It was an epic fail in all aspects - plot, acting, and overall execution. The storyline was cliched, predictable, and felt like it was directly ripped off from other successful films. The characters were cartoonish, making it impossible for the audience to care about their fates. The dialogue was painfully awkward, leaving one to wonder if they were hearing a first draft that somehow made it through to the final production. The actors' performances left a lot to be desired. One may argue that they were doing their best, given the abysmal material they had to work with. However, their lack of passion and connection with their roles was palpable. It seemed as though everyone was just here for the paycheck and nothing more. Visually, the movie was a mess as well. Every scene looked as though it was shot on the first take, without any thought given to lighting, angles, and framing. Although the special effects were somewhat passable, it could not save the rest of this disaster. In conclusion, this movie is not worth your time or your hard-earned money. Instead, go catch up on your favorite series or rewatch a classic that you know will not disappoint. If, however, you find yourself in a position where you must watch this train wreck of a film, brace yourself for a cringeworthy experience that will leave you questioning the state of modern cinema.", "Food-associated cues can indeed alter forebrain functional connectivity, as assessed with immediate early gene and proenkephalin expression. Studies have shown that exposure to food cues, such as images or smells of palatable food, can trigger neuronal activation in brain reward circuits involved in the motivation, learning, and regulation of food intake. Immediate early genes (IEGs), such as c-fos and zif268, are rapidly induced in response to various stimuli, including food-associated cues, and are often used as markers of neuronal activation. Research has demonstrated that food cues can lead to increased IEG expression in several brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These brain regions are part of the mesolimbic dopamine system and play crucial roles in reward processing, motivation, and decision-making. Proenkephalin (PENK) is a precursor protein that gives rise to several bioactive peptides, including enkephalins, which are endogenous opioid peptides. PENK is expressed in various brain regions, including the striatum, amygdala, and hypothalamus, and has been implicated in mediating the hedonic and motivational aspects of food intake. Food-associated cues have been shown to modulate PENK expression in these brain regions, suggesting a role for endogenous opioid signaling in the neural response to food cues. The alterations in IEG and proenkephalin expression in response to food-associated cues indicate that these cues can impact the functional connectivity of the forebrain, leading to changes in neuronal activity and signaling within brain circuits involved in food reward and motivation. This helps explain why exposure to food cues can contribute to increased craving and overeating in both humans and animals, and could be an important factor to consider in developing strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity and eating disorders.", "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been studied as a potential treatment for mobilizing endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). EPCs are known to play a role in vascular repair, angiogenesis, and maintaining endothelial function. Some studies have shown that G-CSF can mobilize EPCs in patients with CAD, thereby promoting angiogenesis and improving myocardial perfusion. However, the results of such studies are not entirely consistent, and more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of G-CSF as a therapy for CAD and its mechanism of action on EPC mobilization. Additionally, factors such as patient characteristics and the presence of other conditions or therapies might also affect the response of EPCs to G-CSF treatment.", "Person1: That's unfortunate, Cleo.

The OATP1B1 (organic anion-transporting polypeptide) is a liver-specific transporter, and polymorphism T521CA388G is associated with reduced uptake of bilirubin into hepatocytes, which can lead to an increased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, a condition characterized by elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. This can result in jaundice, and in severe cases, can lead to brain damage or other serious complications if not treated. Genotyping for this polymorphism can help identify at-risk individuals and guide appropriate management strategies.", "Every time the supposed explorers and we , the audience, is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds, for some ungodly reason, the filmmakers decided to distract with an \"emergency\" or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense. So instead of calmly enjoying the surface of Io, or standing over the rings of Saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid, we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters. Big let down !!!!The filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want. A documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system, or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject matter. Come on. Hello. If I wanted suspense and tension I'd watch a real Narrative sci-fi movie. Sure it's a docu-drama. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - should be secondary to the subject matter). Wait. Yes the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject matter - since essentially this is a film about a space mission , not just about the solar system. But it was overplayed and distracted strongly from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to be enjoying. Otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic feel for the human elements of a space mission , the squabbles, the tensions, the weight of responsibility, the near-fatal mistakes, the sacrifices , etc. Also it would fit very well in the hard-sci-fi subgenre - in fact it would be one of the best , because here the science was almost closely adhered to.

The struggling Barclays Premier League champions know they need more English players in their starting line-up - goalkeeper Joe Hart has often been the only one this season - and Liverpool's Henderson and Arsenal's Wilshere are deemed to be realistic targets. City also maintain an interest in Liverpool's unsettled England forward Raheem Sterling, with 36-year-old veteran Frank Lampard set to leave and 29-year-old James Milner likely to follow him out of the Etihad Stadium.

Wilshere tries to cut inside during his appearance for Arsenal's Under 21 side on Tuesday night . Liverpool's Jordan Henderson is another surprise name among targets of Manchester City for this summer . ManchesterCity also maintain an interest in Liverpool's unsettled forward Raheem Sterling . Henderson, 24, has come to City's attention because he has only one year left on his Liverpool contract. Their concern about Wilshere, 23, who has over two years left on his Arsenal deal, is his injury record. He has yet to return to Arsene Wenger's side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in November. There is a well-trodden path between Arsenal and City over the past five years. The Manchester club, who offer far bigger salaries, have spent 80million on Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy. Frank Lampard was among the few English representatives for Manchester City at Selhurst Park . Joe Hart (centre) was the only England player that started while James Milner (right) came on as a sub . Wilshere played 90 minutes for Arsenal as he stepped up in his return from injury at the Emirates .

Not all of City's targets will be English, though, with the club willing to use France star Nasri and Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko as bait in a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United's books before moving to Italy. City see him as the long-term successor to the fading Yaya Toure, although Pogba could cost as much as 60m. Nasri and Dzeko have had poor seasons and are expected to be part of a summer cull.

While some lauded her captivating performance, others are questioning the appropriateness of including a traditional belly dance at a football award ceremony. Hailing as one of Egypt's most celebrated dancers, Dina Talaat's flawless dance routine captured the audience's attention at the CAF event. However, her performance has received a mixed response from the public. Critics claim that a belly dance act was not suitable for an event focused on celebrating the achievements of African football. In an exclusive interview, Dina Talaat said, \"I do not know what all the fuss is about. I was invited to perform at the event and was not aware that it would lead to such heated discussions.\" On the other hand, fans of the dancer have taken to social media, supporting her and claiming that her performance showcased an important aspect of Egyptian culture, which was an integral part of the event's theme. They believe her artistic performance added color and life to the ceremony, honoring the diversity of African cultures. While the authorities have not issued any statements regarding the controversy surrounding Dina Talaat's performance, it has paved the way for intense discussions about the role of art, culture, and tradition in international events such as this. The CAF event, held annually, aims to honor and acknowledge the best footballers in Africa and the teams that have shown exceptional performance throughout the year. Amidst the debate generated by Dina Talaat's performance, it is crucial to remember the primary purpose of the event - to celebrate the talented athletes and their contributions to the world of football.", "Person1: Thanks for joining us today, Robin. So, tell us a bit about the Martha Bicycle Club and what you guys do. Person2: Thanks for having me, Ann. The Martha Bicycle Club is a group of cycling enthusiasts who love to promote the use of bicycles as a sustainable and healthy mode of transport. We organize regular weekend group rides, workshops, and events such as bike races and charity fundraisers. Person1: Sounds like a lot of fun! Can you tell us about any upcoming events or activities that our listeners might be interested in? Person2: Certainly! Next weekend, we're hosting a cycling safety workshop in collaboration with the local city council. Our aim is to educate riders of all ages on the dos and don'ts of cycling, proper bike maintenance and the importance of wearing helmets. We'll also be providing free bike check-ups. Person1: That's a fantastic initiative. How can someone interested in the workshop participate or find more information?

Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the 'most creative' player in the world. 'The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,' said Cantona, 'Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.' Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders 29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi's 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo's 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona's assessment. 'Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.' Cantona was third in the Ballon d'Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . 'Catalonia won the World Cup,' said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. 'Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. 'My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war. So, I am very proud of Barcelona and all that they have done. 'I'm sure that as soon as the youth set-up from Barcelona and other Spanish teams draw new, good players, Spain will emerge again.'", "Person1: Yes, I believe it's better to know the outcome rather than just waiting and stressing about it.

We're all quite good at it, in fact. That being said, let me tell you how much I hated this movie.To begin with, it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, they capture him but he escapes in this big ol' shoot out. There's this singer whom we think died, only she didn't, unless maybe there are several of them who all act and look the same. Cue Burt Reynolds to come in and question the singer. He looks like he's just wandered into this movie off of the Walker, Texas Ranger set and is darn confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, only he doesn't... And the worst thing is, there's not enough dialogue or action that doesn't involve killing people or attempting to to even make fun of this movie!! And don't even get me started on the random chihuahua. Then there was the fact that it was supposed to be about the old power structure in Eastern-Europe falling apart. We didn't know where we were, all the accents were apparently \"Eastern-European\" and what were Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe doing there in the first place?I desperately wanted to tell the people at Blockbuster what I thought of this movie, and to get my money back, but since I'd gotten it as a special (only .99) I decided against it.

Alavi was at work when she reportedly received a mysterious phone call and left without explanation. She was later found dead on Saturday morning by a colleague in the shopping center's car park. Authorities allege that Alavi was stabbed to death with a pair of scissors. Her estranged husband has been charged with her murder and has been refused bail. Alavi's sister revealed her sibling's desperate search for safety, visiting multiple shelters every day, only to be turned away each time. Her sister stated that Leila felt like there was nowhere else to turn for help and was unable to escape the abusive relationship. The tragic incident has shed light on the struggles that many women face when trying to leave abusive relationships and the lack of resources available at emergency women's shelters. Women's shelters and support services continue to be underfunded, which often leads to women in need being turned away or left feeling helpless. The tragic death of Leila Alavi calls for an urgent need to address the demand for safe spaces and support for women at risk.

That being said, the movie \"Breakthrough\" managed to break through my skepticism and grab my attention with its inspiring and emotional story. The film follows the incredible journey of John Smith, a young teenager who falls through the ice of a frozen lake and remains submerged for over 15 agonizing minutes. Doctors announce his tragic demise, but his mother Joyce is relentless in her belief and prayers, resulting in the miraculous moment when John's heart begins to beat again. The narrative incorporates themes of faith, community, and the power of a mother's love with moving performances by Chrissy Metz, Josh Lucas, and Topher Grace. The movie avoids being too preachy by balancing the miraculous events with scientific explanations and doubts expressed by doctors and even the protagonist himself. The cinematography and direction are beautifully executed, with compelling visuals depicting both the dramatic incident and the serene beauty of the frozen lakeside town. The film also showcases the strength and unity of the community through emotional scenes that display how friends, neighbors, and even strangers come together to support the grieving family. As an atheist, I didn't expect to be so deeply moved by a film centered around faith and prayer. However, \"Breakthrough\" does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of human spirit, love, and resilience in the face of adversity. The movie is a genuinely heartwarming and inspirational experience that will leave you reflecting on the strength of human connection and the mysterious events that defy scientific explanation.

Some studies have demonstrated that miRNAs, such as miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, and miR-223, have the ability to play a role in the suppression of SIV replication. These four miRNAs bind to specific targets in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of SIV, leading to the degradation of viral RNA or inhibition of translation and thus reducing viral replication. However, it is important to note that the SIV-host interaction is complex, and other cellular factors and pathways also contribute to the regulation of viral replication. Furthermore, the role of these miRNAs in HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) replication, which is closely related to SIV, needs to be further explored. In conclusion, while there is evidence to suggest that miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, and miR-223 can directly downregulate SIV replication, the overall picture of viral regulation is more complex and involves multiple host and viral factors.", "The phrase \"sum of parts greater than the whole\" is generally used to express the idea that the value or effectiveness of something is greater when its parts are combined than when they are considered separately. In the context of the genetic history of populations, it may mean that the various genetic components that make up a particular population contribute to a more complex genetic history than what can be understood by looking at them individually. Studying the common genetic history of different populations often involves looking at the shared genetic components and their influence on the overall genetic makeup of the group. While it is true that a deeper and broader understanding of genetic history can be obtained by studying these shared components, the sum of parts greater than the whole concept does not directly apply to the question of the common genetic history of populations. Understanding the common genetic history of populations involves analyzing various factors like gene flow, migration, admixture, and population isolation, all of which contribute to the genetic diversity within populations. Each population's unique genetic history results from the interplay of these factors, and while some genetic components may be shared among populations, the overall genetic history of each population still remains distinct. In conclusion, while the study of the common genetic history of populations certainly benefits from examining the shared genetic components, it does not necessarily mean that the sum of these parts is greater than the whole in terms of genetic history. Instead, the genetic history of populations is best understood by considering the complex interplay of all contributing factors on a case-by-case basis.", "Yes, the incidence of domestic animal bites can increase following a disaster due to natural hazards. During such events, pets and other domestic animals may experience fear, stress, confusion, and displacement, which can make them more likely to bite or otherwise behave aggressively. Disasters like earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes can lead to the destruction of homes, shelters, and other structures, forcing both people and animals to seek safety elsewhere. This breakdown of the familiar environment can cause animals to become disoriented and frightened, which may result in an increase in biting incidents. Moreover, many people try to rescue or assist injured or displaced animals during a natural disaster. However, these animals might be scared or in pain, so their behavior might change, and these circumstances could increase the likelihood of aggressive responses, including biting. To avoid getting bitten by a domestic animal during a disaster: 1. Approach the animal calmly and speak in a soothing voice. 2. Do not make any sudden movements or loud noises. 3. If the animal appears aggressive or agitated, keep a safe distance, and avoid direct eye contact. 4. Be aware of the body language of the animal - raised or stiff hair, bared teeth, growling or hissing, and flattened ears are all signs of aggression or fear. 5. Do not attempt to handle an injured animal without proper training or protective gear. It is crucial to have disaster preparedness plans in place for pets and domestic animals to reduce stress, disorientation, and the likelihood of biting incidents. This includes having an emergency pet supply kit, familiarizing animals with crates and carriers, and identifying pet-friendly shelters or temporary housing options in advance.", "BBC to Air Two-Hour Real-Time Documentary Following a Boat: A Change of Pace from the Frenetic World of TV In an unconventional move, the BBC is set to air a two-hour, real-time documentary that simply follows a boat on its journey. For some viewers, this may be as interesting as watching paint dry. Still, the Corporation hopes that the languid film will provide a much-needed change of pace from the frenetic and fast-paced world of modern television. As streaming platforms and digital networks continue to churn out high-octane, fast-paced content to capture viewer attention, the BBC's bold decision to broadcast a slow, gentle documentary is clearly intended as a breath of fresh air for viewers seeking more calming and contemplative content. The two-hour long documentary, which is yet to be titled, will feature stunning cinematography and immersive soundscapes to create a sense of tranquility and relaxation, offering viewers the opportunity to disconnect from their daily stresses and the barrage of attention-grabbing content that has come to define television today. \"This documentary could be an antidote to our constant need for stimulation and distraction,\" explains a spokesperson for the BBC. \"As our lives become busier and more hectic, the idea of sitting down to watch something calming, slow-paced and reflective might just be what we need to unwind and recharge.\" The film's unique selling point, however, has already drawn polarizing opinions. Some social media users have expressed excitement at the prospect of a \"slow TV\" approach, praising the BBC for taking a creative risk and offering a much-needed change of pace from the usual high-energy programming. On the other hand, some viewers have questioned the entertainment value of such a documentary, with some commenting that it will be as dull as watching paint dry. The film may be dismissed as an artistic indulgence and could potentially struggle to make a significant impact in the current TV landscape. Regardless of whether the documentary resonates with its intended audience, the BBC's decision to venture into \"slow TV\" territory demonstrates the broadcaster's willingness to innovate and experiment with new formats in an increasingly competitive industry. It remains to be seen whether the film will become a cult hit or fade away in the ever-growing catalogue of television content. In addition to the boat documentary, the broadcaster is also exploring other potential \"slow TV\" projects and programs in various genres, as part of a broader strategy to engage with audiences seeking alternative and soothing viewing experiences.", "Person1: Let's say, more than a couple of drinks per week?

Researchers have long debated the possibility of traces of water existing on Mars. The latest findings on Martian weather seem to indicate that the planet may have temporary, albeit tiny, bodies of liquid water on its surface in the form of salty puddles. Dr. [Insert Name], an astrobiologist at the [Insert Institute], said that the discovery of these salty puddles could have \"wider implications\" for ongoing efforts to find extraterrestrial life on Mars. \"Water is a basic requirement for life, and the presence of even small amounts of liquid water on Mars increases the chances of finding evidence of some form of life there,\" they explained. Previous missions to Mars, such as NASA's Mars Rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have provided ample evidence that the Red Planet was once a wet world with a potentially habitable environment. It is believed that billions of years ago, large amounts of water flowed across the Martian surface, even forming rivers and lakes. However, the Martian atmosphere gradually lost its density over time, and the planet's surface has become a harsh, desiccated landscape with very little water left. The presence of liquid water on Mars today has been reported in the form of ice at its poles and brines (extremely salty water) below its surface. The discovery of salty puddles was made possible by analyzing the Martian weather conditions, which comprise of extreme temperature changes in a single day. During Martian nights, when the temperature drops significantly, water vapor present in the atmosphere may condense to form tiny droplets of liquid water mixed with various salts. These salty puddles are thought to be temporary and likely evaporate as the Martian day progresses and temperatures rise. Although not a substantial source of water, these puddles may play a crucial role in sustaining microbial life for a short period. Dr. [Insert Name] added that \"finding these salty puddles will not be a simple task, as their fleeting nature and small size make them difficult to detect.\" However, with advancements in technology and upcoming Martian missions, the chances of identifying these elusive puddles and understanding their implications for life on Mars are bound to improve. The search for life on Mars and the study of its hydrological history have been of great interest to the scientific community. The discovery of salty puddles and their potential link to microbial life on the Red Planet continues to provide valuable information that may help us understand the evolution of water and life on our neighboring planet.", "This movie sucks so bad. Its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained American twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. Its just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. As for the bit where they make the French President drink 'bad water', that was just lame. I don't think he would have been too pleased in real life. Everything worked out too easily for the girls, and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie, if it at all depicted real life.My Rating: 0 10", "While the dog was cute, the film was not. \"Canine Capers\" attempted to capture audiences with its adorable furry lead, but the story was disjointed and lacked any real substance. Directed by Mike Barker, the film follows the misadventures of a plucky pup named Sparky who seems to find himself constantly getting into trouble. However, the movie falls short in terms of plot, character development, and overall execution. The narrative, which centers around Sparky's quest to save his local dog park from unscrupulous developers, feels repetitive and tired. The human characters are one-dimensional and serve little purpose beyond facilitating Sparky's amusing antics. Despite featuring a talented ensemble of well-known actors, the cast fails to elevate the lackluster and cliched dialogues. It is evident that the primary focus was put on capturing the charm and appeal of the furry protagonist, with little thought given to the storyline or supporting cast. Visually, \"Canine Capers\" excels in showcasing the whimsical and picturesque world that serves as a backdrop for Sparky's adventures. The cinematography is colorful and vibrant, providing a family-friendly atmosphere that will undoubtedly enchant younger viewers. It would have been an asset if the film had paid closer attention to the emotional depth that typically strengthens the bond between humans and dogs. Instead, the film's emphasis on slapstick humor and silliness overwhelms the opportunity to build meaningful relationships between the characters, both human and canine alike. While it is undeniable that \"Canine Capers\" manages to elicit a chuckle or two from its audience, the film is ultimately forgettable and falls short of other notable dog-centric movies. It is a pity that such a cute canine protagonist had to suffer from a subpar plot and underdeveloped characters, which leave a less than memorable impression.", "Fas signaling has been reported to induce lipid raft coalescence, which plays a role in the signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis in various cell types, including human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Lipid rafts are specialized membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and they act as platforms for the assembly of signaling proteins, such as Fas receptor. Cholesterol depletion can disrupt lipid raft organization, preventing the clustering of signaling molecules and blocking downstream signaling. In human RPE cells undergoing apoptosis, it is plausible that cholesterol depletion could block Fas-induced raft coalescence, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. However, the exact effects of cholesterol depletion on Fas signaling and raft coalescence in human RPE cells undergoing apoptosis may vary depending on cell conditions, research methods, and experimental setup. Further research is needed to have more conclusive findings about the specific interactions between Fas signaling, raft coalescence, and cholesterol depletion in human RPE cells undergoing apoptosis.", "Thus, hearts-and-minds approaches are generally more effective than force in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, and partial insurance is usually a better tactic than gag rules in quelling financial panics. Differences between suppression tactics are greater when individual incentives to support terrorist or insurgent groups, or susceptibilities to financial panic, are higher. These conclusions have utility for policy-makers seeking to end bloody conflicts and prevent financial panics. As the model also applies to mass protest, its conclusions provide insight as well into the likely effects of different suppression strategies undertaken by authoritarian regimes seeking to hold on to power in the face of mass movements seeking to end them.", "Renault have promised Red Bull that they will resolve previous power-unit problems, following a threat by Red Bull owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, to pull out of Formula 1. This news comes after the recent Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, where Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso both suffered a power-unit failure. Renault has taken responsibility for the situation, with managing director, Cyril Abiteboul, stating: \"As a group, we must react and shift our focus to reliability before we can make any further assurances on performance.\" He went on to explain that immediately after the race, Renault met with Red Bull and Toro Rosso representatives to ensure the situation was properly investigated and promptly resolved. Despite these issues, Renault believes they have made significant progress since the season opener in Australia, not only in terms of operational performance, but also with overall power-unit durability. Abiteboul also noted that the engine manufacturer is pleased with the power unit gains they've made so far, but there is still work to be done. Furthermore, Renault plans to use all the data collected in China to improve ahead of the next race in Spain. Red Bull and Renault were a championship-winning partnership as recently as 2013, but recent power-unit problems have led to a strained relationship, resulting in Mateschitz's recent threat to leave Formula 1.", "I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart several years back (along with \"Hawken's Breed figuring anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is surely worth that much. Boy, was I in for a surprise. The film, titled \"The Mesmerizing Mystery,\" chronicles the life of a magician (Byrne) whose foray into the world of illusion has severe consequences when his magic act embroils him in a scandalous murder mystery. While the premise sounds promising, the execution of the movie left a lot to be desired. The plot seemed convoluted at times and failed to hold my attention throughout. This might be a result of a disorganized script or simply a shortfall in the director's vision. Byrne and Donahoe, despite being powerhouse actors, couldn't salvage this sinking ship of a film, and their performances were nothing more than passable. On the positive side, the movie had some spectacular cinematography, with a few stunningly shot scenes that kept me engaged. The soundtrack was also quite enjoyable, featuring a blend of haunting melodies and suspenseful tunes which somewhat elevated the overall experience. In conclusion, \"The Mesmerizing Mystery\" was a disappointing venture that didn't live up to the potential of its talented cast.

The boy's father claims the child was sleepwalking when he accidentally plunged from their apartment window. According to the father, his son has no memory of the incident and found himself outside on the streets, startled and injured. The Public Security Bureau has been investigating the accident further to ensure there was no foul play involved in the event. Eyewitnesses express their disbelief at the scene, watching in shock as the boy fell and landed on the car below. The impact dented the car's roof but thankfully, cushioned his fall - saving his life. \"I was standing just a few meters away when I saw the boy falling,\" said a witnesses Li Fang. \"It was horrifying, but it's a miracle that he survived.\" Following the accident, the child was rushed to a local hospital, where doctors examined him for life-threatening injuries. Though he sustained multiple fractures, he is said to be in stable condition and on his road to recovery. The car owner, Mr. Zhang, expressed his dismay over the incident as he had bought the car not long ago. \"It was a new car, and now it's destroyed,\" he lamented. However, he also conceded that he is grateful for how the accident turned out. \"Even though it caused me property damage, I'm genuinely glad that the boy survived. It's much more important than the car,\" said Zhang. With cases of sleepwalking becoming more common in recent years, parents need to be more aware of the potential risks it could pose to their children. Proper measures such as securing window locks and doors before bedtime could help prevent accidents like these in the future.

Summary: Researchers have found that our instinct to avoid spiders could be a result of evolution. Dating back to early human evolution in Africa, arachnophobia may represent a survival instinct in response to the threat of venomous spiders. Body: Arachnophobia, or the fear of spiders, may be deeply rooted in our evolutionary need to survive, according to a new study by an international team of scientists. Our instinct to avoid these eight-legged creatures could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago. The study theorized that primates developed the instinct to avoid arachnids as an evolutionary response to this threat. \"Relatively few primates feed on spiders, and this has been noted as remarkable given that they are slow-moving and can be found in large numbers,\" said Dr. Joshua Levy, a research fellow at the University of Oxford. \"This study demonstrates that there might be good reasons for this pattern, that the creatures we find so scary today were dangerous predators during our evolutionary past.\" The findings suggest that arachnophobia might not just be an irrational fear, but rather a deeply ingrained survival instinct. \"Fear of spiders is incredibly common, with arachnophobia being one of the most commonly reported phobias,\" said Dr. Levy. \"It's possible that developing a high level of vigilance towards spiders was important for helping early humans survive.\" While many modern spiders are not harmful to humans, those that lived millions of years ago during early human evolution may have posed a significant threat. Even today, a handful of spider species, such as the Black Widow, can be dangerous when provoked, containing venom that can harm or even kill humans. However, these species are generally rare and seldom pose a threat to human populations. \"The idea that some spiders posed deadly threats to early humans and other large primates, and that there was intense selection pressure to detect and avoid them, could explain the apparently irrational fear that is still ingrained today,\" concluded Dr. Levy. With this newfound understanding of the origins of arachnophobia, researchers hope to shed light on the development of fear responses in general and improve therapies for patients suffering from phobias, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Future studies may also focus on understanding the evolutionary basis for fear of other creatures, such as snakes, which also have a widespread prevalence of phobias among humans. Arachnophobia may be an evolutionary survival instinct that has lingered into the modern era. Nonetheless, this new perspective on our seemingly irrational fear of spiders could provide valuable insights into the broader understanding and treatment of human phobias.", "Signaling cascades primarily transmit information downstream, as they involve a series of molecular events that amplify and transmit signals received at a cell's surface to specific target molecules in the cell's interior. The primary flow of information is unidirectional, from the cell surface to the interior. However, there can be some cross-talk and feedback mechanisms in signaling cascades, where downstream molecules can influence upstream molecules. This is not the main function of signaling cascades, but it does happen under specific circumstances and helps to fine-tune and regulate the overall signaling process. Still, simultaneous transmission of information in both the downstream and upstream directions is not considered a typical feature of signaling cascades.", "This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it.

Person2: It was a heart bypass surgery. Thankfully, the operation went well, but the recovery process will take some time. Person1: I'm glad the surgery was successful. If you don't mind me asking, what caused the need for surgery? Person2: Susan had been experiencing some chest pains and shortness of breath lately.

Dadaev, a former police officer from the Chechen Republic, is the main suspect in the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was shot dead on a bridge near the Kremlin in February 2015. The murder sparked an outpouring of grief and outrage in Russia, with many suspecting it was politically motivated. Following his arrest in early March 2015, Dadaev reportedly confessed to the murder, but later retracted his statement. In a recent court hearing, Dadaev claimed that he was kidnapped, subjected to severe beatings and threats, and ultimately forced to confess to a crime he did not commit. \"I was abducted, I was taken away, I was beaten and tortured,\" Dadaev told the jury during the trial. \"On the third day, when I refused to admit to the murder, they said that if I didn't confess, they would take me to a forest and kill me there.\" Dadaev's defense attorney, Mark Kaverzin, backed up his client's allegations and told the court that marks of torture were still visible on Dadaev's body, days after his arrest. In addition, witnesses provided testimony to support Dadaev's claims that he was abducted before being arrested. Despite these claims, prosecutors maintain that there is substantial evidence tying Dadaev to the crime, including surveillance footage, witness accounts, and cell phone data that places him at the scene of the crime. They argue that the murder was carefully planned and executed by a group of individuals, led by Dadaev, who were promised a financial reward in exchange for carrying out the hit. During the trial, Dadaev admitted to being in Moscow on the night of the murder, but insisted that he had nothing to do with it. He claims that he was forced to admit to the crime in order to protect his family, who he believes are still in danger. The trial is one of several high-profile cases involving the assassination of prominent Kremlin critics in recent years. In October 2021, another suspected Kremlin critic, Vitaly Chornyluk, was fatally shot by an unknown assailant outside his home in Kyiv, Ukraine. While there is no direct link between the cases, they have fueled speculation about the mounting risks faced by those who dare to challenge Putin's regime. Dadaev's trial is ongoing, and if convicted, he could face up to life in prison.", "Person1: Hi! How are things going with you? Person2: I am doing well. What's up with you?

Daniel Filmus, Argentina's secretary of state for the islands, told an event in London that Britain's decision to increase military spending in the South Atlantic was 'gunboat diplomacy'. Mr Filmus said military conflict 'belongs to the past' and claimed: 'The United Kingdom can count on Argentina as an ally.' Argentina has branded British attempts to explore the seas around the Falklands Islands for oil 'illegitimate' But he added: 'The unilateral and illegitimate appropriation of non-renewable natural resources that is being carried out by the UK in the South Atlantic has been the subject of continued protest by the Argentine Republic. 'Argentina has been forced to resort to defensive measures,' he said, using 'the law and political action as its main tools in order to protect the natural resources in the area under dispute'. He said Argentinian judicial authorities would consider the case against British companies involved in the oil exploration. Addressing the question of possible future conflict, Mr Filmus said: 'Argentina bears no grudge against the inhabitants of the islands in spite of all the manoeuvres designed to prove otherwise. 'What Argentina is not going to do is give in. We do not wish to spend another penny on arms. It is through negotiations that we will solve this. 'We do not know how many years it will take... But what justification can there be for mothers crying over the deaths of their sons? It really must be dialogue.' Daniel Filmus's commentssparked a furious reaction from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured) Mr Filmus's comments sparked a furious reaction from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who told Sky News: 'It is an outrageous piece of bullying and threatening against the Falkland islanders' perfect right to develop their own economic resources and Argentina needs to stop this kind of behaviour and start acting like a responsible member of the international community.' Britain defeated Argentina in a 1982 war over the South Atlantic islands and administers them as an overseas territory, whose population of around 3,000 voted overwhelmingly to remain under British rule in a referendum in 2013. Argentina says it is the rightful owner of the islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, a claim dating back centuries to the Spanish colonial era. The dispute has escalated in recent years with the discovery of oil and gas deposits.", "Manchester United Prepare for 50m Double Raid on Borussia Dortmund It appears that Manchester United is ready to make a major splash in the transfer market this summer. Sources close to the club have reported that German duo Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels are set to make their moves to Old Trafford in a deal worth over 50m. Both players have privately indicated that they feel the time is right for a new start and are eager to join the Premier League giants. Gundogan, a highly-rated central midfielder, is expected to complete a 15m transfer, making the move to Manchester in the summer after struggling with injuries throughout his career. Joining him will be his Borussia Dortmund teammate, center-back Mats Hummels, who is rumored to be finally ready to become a United player after being linked with the club for several years. The signings of Gundogan and Hummels will likely be just a portion of the spending spree planned for this summer. United's management is reportedly prepared to hand manager Louis van Gaal a 150m transfer kitty in an attempt to bolster the squad for the 201516 season. These additions would not only provide Manchester United with two highly skilled players but also significantly strengthen the German core of the squad, joining the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Antonio Valencia. The combination of talent and depth will surely make Manchester United a more formidable force in both domestic and European competitions. Fans of the Red Devils will likely be ecstatic at the prospect of spending upwards of 50m to secure the services of both Gundogan and Hummels, indicating a significant statement of intent from the club. Manchester United has been attempting to re-establish itself among the footballing elite since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 and the arrivals of these two quality players will only serve to further bolster the club's credentials.", "Sand Springs Police Release Bodycam Footage of Officer-Involved Shooting Sand Springs, OK - The Sand Springs Police Department has released bodycam footage showing details of the fatal shooting of a 66-year-old man by a police officer in mid-April. According to a statement from the department, Officer Brian Barnett, 25, shot and killed Donald Allen on April 11 after the man had made threatening statements and was observed advancing with a loaded 22-caliber pistol. The video, which was released on May 3, was said to have been recovered from a malfunctioning camera. It has been turned over to the Tulsa County District Attorney, who will determine whether the use of force was justified. The footage shows Officer Barnett responding to a call for service at the residence of Allen. In the video, Allen can be heard making several threatening comments directed towards the officer. After multiple requests for Allen to drop the weapon with no compliance, the video shows Officer Barnett firing one shot at the man, who was later pronounced dead at the scene. The incident has raised questions about the use of force by police officers, with some calling for more transparency and accountability in such situations. Sand Springs Police Department spokesperson Capt. Todd Enzbrenner stressed the importance of the bodycam evidence in this case, stating that it \"provides a first-hand account of what occurred at the scene and provides our department, as well as the community, an opportunity for a greater understanding of the events that transpired.\" The Tulsa County District Attorney is expected to make a decision on whether any charges will be filed against Officer Barnett in the coming weeks, after a thorough review of the video evidence and findings from the investigation.", "Yes, reproductive tradeoffs can limit the predatory efficiency of female Arizona Bark Scorpions (Centruroides sculpturatus). During reproduction, female scorpions carry their eggs and later, their offspring, on their backs, which can affect their mobility and hunting ability. The added weight of the young scorpions and the increased energy requirements for reproduction can impact the female's predatory efficiency. Additionally, the need to protect the offspring may lead to altercation in hunting and foraging behavior, resulting in reduced predatory success. Therefore, reproduction can indeed limit the predatory efficiency of the female Arizona Bark Scorpions during the period of childcare and contribute to the overall fitness tradeoffs for the mother scorpion.", "Everyone is entitled to an opinion.

Fans around the world are excited to see how both teams fare, especially with the added sentimental value of Bayern Munich's manager, Pep Guardiola, returning to his old stomping grounds at the Nou Camp. Guardiola, a renowned former Spanish professional footballer and current Bayern boss, is no stranger to Barcelona. Having played for the team from 1990 to 2001, and served as their head coach between 2008 and 2012, Guardiola's connection to the city and the club runs deep. This homecoming adds an extra element of emotion and excitement to the already intense match-up. The UEFA Champions League draw results can be found [INSERT LINK HERE]. One of Guardiola's most significant challenges during this showdown will be finding a way to stop Lionel Messi, Barcelona's star player and record-breaking goal-scorer. Messi has been on fire recently, and continually increasing his impressive tally of goals during the current UEFA Champions League campaign. Guardiola himself has previously labelled Messi as \"the best player of all time,\" and knows that stopping the Argentine forward will be decisive for Bayern Munich's chances of advancing to the finals. This match-up is bound to be a thrilling contest between two of the best teams in the world, and it will be interesting to see how both sides handle the mounting pressure, as the competition for the prestigious UEFA Champions League title intensifies. With Guardiola's emotional homecoming and the relentless talent displayed by players such as Lionel Messi, the stage is set for a truly monumental clash.", "Yes, it has been suggested that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa- ligand (RANKL) can coordinate cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation in osteoclasts through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27KIP1 and p21CIP1. RANKL is involved in osteoclast differentiation, and it is considered to promote cell cycle arrest and differentiation by upregulation of these two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Studies have reported that RANKL can induce the expression of p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages and preosteoclast cell lines, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This cell cycle arrest is essential for proper differentiation of osteoclasts, as it prevents undesirable proliferation of the cells. The upregulation of p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 by RANKL is thought to play a critical role in this process, providing a link between cell cycle regulation and osteoclast differentiation. Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms of how RANKL regulates these cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are not yet fully understood, and further studies are necessary to elucidate the complexity of this process within the bone microenvironment.", "While I rather enjoyed this movie, I'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't. She's not one for graphic violence and intense plot twists, but as a fan of suspenseful thrillers, I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The cinematography was outstanding, drawing me into the dark and gritty atmosphere that enveloped each frame. The acting, especially from the lead character, was top-notch, portraying a perfect blend of vulnerability and determination that made me both empathize and root for her. The plot moved at a brisk pace, gradually building the tension and stakes until the film reached its explosive climax. The twists and turns along the way kept me engaged and guessing, and the final reveal left me stunned and pleasantly surprised. The realistic, flawed characters, coupled with their believable motivations, made the story all the more compelling. Although the violence was certainly graphic and at times a bit too gory for my taste, I found it to be crucial in conveying the overall tone and atmosphere of the movie. It served to accent the dark, desperate nature of the characters and their situations. While this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea (especially not my mother's), I highly recommend giving it a watch if you're a fan of tense, gripping stories with unexpected plot twists. Its captivating visuals, stellar acting, and sharply honed plot make it a must-see for thriller aficionados.", "Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) concentrate is a highly purified, highly effective treatment option for patients with hemophilia A or B and high-responding inhibitors. It has become the standard treatment for these patients due to its safety profile. On the other hand, plasma-derived concentrates are derived from human plasma and contain a mixture of clotting factors. These concentrates can be effective but carry a slightly increased risk of transmitting viral infections when compared to recombinant products. In general, rFVIIa concentrate is preferred over plasma-derived concentrates for treating acute bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia and inhibitors. However, the choice of treatment depends on the specific clinical circumstances of each patient, and a healthcare provider should be consulted to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.", "Yes, a decline in serum tumor markers (such as AFP and HCG) can be an early predictor of treatment outcome in germ cell tumor patients treated with cisplatin and ifosfamide salvage chemotherapy. These tumor markers are often used to monitor treatment response and disease progression.

However, it is important to keep in mind that these markers alone are not the only tools used to evaluate treatment response and other factors such as clinical examination, imaging studies, and overall patient's health should also be considered.", "Ocimum sanctum, also known as holy basil or tulsi, is an herb used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties. Some studies have shown that holy basil leaf extracts can potentially attenuate human monocytic (THP-1) cell activation (Jain et al., 2016). A study by Jamshidi and Cohen (2017) reviewed the pharmacological properties of Ocimum sanctum and discussed its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The study indicates that holy basil leaf extracts may inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytic THP-1 cells. Another study by Jain and colleagues (2016) showed that Ocimum sanctum leaf extracts could attenuate the lipopolysaccharide-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulate the expression of inflammatory genes in THP-1 cells. These studies provide evidence that Ocimum sanctum leaf extracts may potentially attenuate monocytic (THP-1) cell activation, which could contribute to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Further research is needed to explore this effect in more detail and better understand the underlying mechanisms. References: 1. Jain, P., Khanna, N. K., TeFenyi, A., Saxena, R., Bhardwaj, A. (2016).

However, I was immediately captivated by the gripping storyline, complex characters, and beautiful cinematography. The pilot of this series showcased the potential to be a standout among other TV dramas, and it undoubtedly left me wanting more. The opening scenes effectively set the mood and intrigue as we are introduced to a dysfunctional family with a convoluted past. As the story unfolds, the layers of multidimensional characters begin to unravel, revealing their true selves and the reasons behind their eccentric behavior. Furthermore, the screenplay is smartly written and offers some surprising twists and turns that are both unexpected and thought-provoking. The acting performances were phenomenal, particularly from the lead actors who expertly balanced the emotional gravity and subtle nuances of their roles. Their chemistry and on-screen presence felt raw and compelling, pulling the viewer deeper into the world of the show. Visually, the series is stunning with its exceptional cinematography and picturesque locales. The creative team seems to have a keen eye for detail and knows how to capture the beauty of the landscapes without undermining the gravity of the storyline. Moreover, the show's pacing is well-balanced which allows the audience to invest and connect with the characters without feeling overwhelmed by the twists and developments. In conclusion, the first episode of this series has left an indelible impression on me, promising a thrilling and complex journey ahead. I am eagerly looking forward to binge-watching the remaining episodes and delving into the intricate world that the creators have crafted so masterfully. For anyone who appreciates intelligent and captivating storytelling, I recommend giving this show a chance - you won't be disappointed.", "Human ARPE-19 cells in culture contain membrane rafts with apoptotic signaling effectors uniformly distributed in the native state. The cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis appear to use membrane rafts in the death-signaling process by mobilization of rafts to localized regions of the membrane that are now enriched with apoptotic signaling effectors. Fas signaling induces apoptotic raft formation that results in polar condensation, or capping, of the rafts in the late stages of apoptosis. A novel extrusion technique is described that allows localization and enrichment of rafts into membrane vesicles, which can be assayed by flow cytometry. Cholesterol depletion, after Fas ligand activation of apoptosis, reduced raft formation in cells induced to undergo apoptosis.

The sweeping landscapes and breathtaking visuals draw us into a world of mysticism and political turmoil, as a young Emperor sets out to conquer and unite a far-reaching empire. The film's massive scale is matched only by the grandeur of its storytelling, as we witness the heartache, determination, and ruthlessness of both the Emperor and his enemies. Perhaps the film's greatest strength lies in its compelling character portrayals. The tragic hero, the young Emperor, is brought to life in a nuanced and awe-inspiring performance. He isn't portrayed merely as a power-hungry tyrant but as a man whose greatness is both his virtue and his downfall. The supporting cast of characters, particularly the Emperor's closest advisors, is equally well-realized. The slippery line between loyalty and betrayal keeps the viewer on edge throughout the story, as the Emperor's quest for unification leads him through both victorious and fatal consequences. The film is accompanied by a powerful score that enhances the dramatic tension and emotional depth of every scene. The visual flair of the action sequences, the painterly beauty of the landscapes, and the lyrical grace of quieter, introspective moments all come together to create a breathtaking cinematic experience. Despite its familiar theme, this epic offers enough in the way of storytelling, character development, and visual grandeur to provide a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking experience. The turmoil and struggle in creating an empire have never been told in such a captivating and visually arresting manner. For those seeking an enthralling historical drama, this film is not to be missed.", "Model:Olsi Beheluli, pictured, claimed he appeared on Channel 4 dating show My Little Princess .

The 24-year-old enjoyed living the 'high life' and gambling with the money he made from the illegal operation, police said. Officers seized more than 4million worth of heroin and cocaine when they raided the gang's 'stash house' in Brent, north west London. They also found stacks of money, counterfeit identity documents, and equipment used for drug dealing. Beheluli was jailed alongside fellow gang members Besim Topalli, 29, and Azem Proshka, 23, for a total of 31 years at Blackfriars Crown Court, London, on Wednesday.

Plagued by an uninspired plot and forgettable characters, the film fails to deliver on its promise of spine-tingling scares and mind-bending twists. Instead, it trudges along, riddled with cliches and relying on tired jump scares that fizzle out after the first act. The visuals, while competently executed, lack the atmospheric flair and sinister ambiance that horror aficionados crave. What's more, it's hard to root for our protagonist, a one-dimensional character who inexplicably makes poor decisions at every turn, making it near impossible for the audience to feel invested in their plight. The supporting cast is equally unremarkable, save for the occasional moment of unintentional humor in a futile attempt to break the monotony. Furthermore, the film buckles under the weight of its unwieldy pacing - its drawn-out scenes make it feel like an eternity before the plot truly kicks into gear. When the climactic revelation finally shuffles into view, it falls spectacularly flat due to the audience's already exhausted patience. One can't help but feel that there was potential here for a truly unique and terrifying experience. Alas, like a nightmare that escapes your mind the moment you wake, this tangle of missed opportunities will quickly fade from your memory. There is little to recommend in this film, and horror fans would be better off exploring the depths of terror in the myriad other, far superior offerings in the genre.", "How do you know if a movie is good or not?

I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of \"happiness\" for all is. Is there justification for the enforced benefit and \"happiness\"? How much can be forfeited for the nation's security and peaceful existence? Is the idea of a powerful would-be empire worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically harassed by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to half hate his subjects for having to renounce his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor should. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused. It seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success.", "(CNN) It was right after one of the longest lockouts in NBA history. Jeff Green, then playing for the Boston Celtics, was looking forward to getting back to the hardwood. That was until a routine physical stopped him in his tracks. The physical revealed he had an aortic aneurysm near the left valve of his heart. \"I was shocked,\" said the Memphis Grizzlies small forward. \"I had no symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath.\" Green had to have open heart surgery. \"Leading up to it was nerve-racking,\" he said. \"I couldn't run. I couldn't touch a basketball. I couldn't get stressed out, it was tough.\" As Green learned how doctors would open up his chest to repair his heart, he considered the possibility he may never play basketball again. \"The first couple of weeks after I was told, I really focused in on my career and what was next,\" said the basketball player. \"I wanted to make sure if I wanted to come back, I was able to come back and play the same way I did before I left.\" If that opportunity wasn't there, Green wanted to have a backup plan. So, he headed back to his college roots at Georgetown University, finished his degree and became the first person in his family to graduate from college. Green's NBA basketball career wasn't over, but it was a slow progression back to the court. He missed the entire 2011-2012 season. \"I didn't even watch any basketball,\" he said. \"Six months after the surgery was the first time I set foot on a court.\" It was with the Hoyas where Green laid back down the foundation of his game, healing his body and regaining muscle. \"The timing was off,\" he said. \"I wasn't concerned about getting hit, the biggest thing was just being in shape and being able to move and being able to function on the floor.\" Green believes the surgery and hard road back to the NBA have given him a new perspective and more meaning in his life. \"I will never forget those days that I could walk 15 steps for five minutes,\" he said. \"Now I attack every game like this could be my last.\" \"I feel like the year I missed really added more years,\" he explained. \"It added more life into what I'm doing because I'm more grateful for it.\" Green's now using his story to raise awareness of hidden heart risk.

Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals - ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it - were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: 'Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I've ever seen before. 'I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. 'It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . 'There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.' According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera's presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. 'I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,' he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.", "Oh, Yawn. Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. I hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. Is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. This movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC's \"Best of Britain\" series. If this is Britain's best, no wonder the British film industry is in trouble.The only bright spot in this film was David Tennant, He plays his character as so despicable that I'm likely to spit on the next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim but comes off in the end as immorally devious as David Tennant's character. They deserve each other.In the mush for brains category are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic Brendan. English policemen are made out to be so incompetent that they're unfit to give out traffic tickets. The British Policeman's Union should sue the makers of this film for defamation.This film isn't worth the electricity it takes to run your DVD to watch it.", "(CNN) It all started by looking up. During an expedition through the Brittany region on the west coast of France, photographer Fabien Le Coq noticed an unusual tree. He positioned himself at the base of the tree and turned his camera upward, filling the frame with the trunk and its spindly branches. \"I'm kind of a walking photographer,\" Le Coq said. \"I love exploring new places. One day I was taking a break during an excursion in the Broceliande forest, looking for the best place to settle, when I discovered a small clearing with a tree without leaves. I stayed for hours looking around, taking some pictures and I found myself lying down under the tree. The tree's branches were rising as if to touch the sky.\" This was the start of the photo series \"Treesome,\" an embodiment of Le Coq's unique way of interacting with the world around him. \"By walking a long time in an environment, landscapes begin to influence on your mood,\" he said. \"As (landscapes) change, your feelings do.\" The series, shot between 2012 and 2014, reflects Le Coq's travels through his native France and countries in Central America and Asia. The images are soothing and repetitive; each tree is photographed from the bottom looking up. But it is from this vantage point that the differences become apparent. Branches take on their own patterns in the sky, creating a symmetry that is both interesting and comforting. A row of trees shot in Paris speaks to the geometry of a modern city. Cactus branches look like spears piercing the sky. Appearance is not the only factor that sets the trees apart. For Le Coq, each image is special because it represents different feelings at different points in time. Social media . Follow CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"Each tree has its own personality,\" he said. \"I chose them by the way I felt at the moment. Sometimes they even change my sentiments. It's kind of a spiritual experience.\" Le Coq says his photographs are meant to bring about pause and reflection. The viewer should \"become a third actor in a scene with trees and skies.\" It is an opportunity to take a break and focus on our own individual journeys. \"Treesome\" is shot in black and white, an aesthetic Le Coq says lends tension \"recalling the gulf on one side and the celestial heights on the other. \"The branches are the mirror of the roots.\" As a freelance graphic designer, Le Coq can work wherever there is an Internet connection. He uses this freedom to travel, discover new places and grow as a photographer.

Person2: That's the beauty of democracy, we're allowed to have differing opinions. I just believe that his stance on certain issues, such as the economy, align with what I think is best for our country. Person1: I agree that it's important to have diverse opinions, but I worry about his divisive rhetoric and how it affects the unity of our country. Person2: There is definitely a need for unity, but I think sometimes strong leadership requires taking a hard stance on certain issues. I guess we'll see what happens in the future.

Drage was jailed following a crash that killed a woman riding a motorbike. As he was released, Drage sang children's songs and mentioned that one of the first things he'll do is go surfing after getting back home. In an exclusive interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night program, Drage said, \"It's definitely not what you expect to be doing on your time in Indonesia. I never thought I'd go to prison in my whole life.\" The accident took place in June 2014 when Drage crashed into a West Java mother of three riding a motorbike. Killed in the accident was 30-year-old Lina Susianti, while her young children and husband suffered minor injuries. Drage, along with his girlfriend who was also on the bike, was uninjured. According to Indonesian police, the motorbike driver was killed while crossing the road illegally. However, Drage was found guilty of \"fatal recklessness\" and sentenced to nine months in an Indonesian prison, in addition to a compensation payment of 37 million Rupiah (2,917). The West Australian man was jailed in a squalid Indonesian prison for nine months, and now plans to focus on being reunited with his family and girlfriend, who supported him through his time at the prison. Throughout his time in prison, Drage maintained his innocence. However, he and his family agreed to pay the compensation required so as not to further entangle himself within the Indonesian legal system. Speaking about his time in the prison, Drage said that it was \"absolutely filthy\" and that he was surrounded by rats and cockroaches throughout his stay. Despite the hard conditions, he was very grateful for the support from his friends and family during his time in prison.", "West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels remained unbeaten on 94 at the end of day one in their final Test against England. The home side was 188 for five after Samuels was dropped on 32. The batsman clashed with England all-rounder Ben Stokes before adding 68 runs in the evening session to end six runs from a seventh Test century. Samuels claimed that a similar exchange with England fast bowler James Anderson back in 2012 helped him to a ton against the Three Lions. Samuels, who was fortunate enough to be dropped on 32, could have been out lbw for the same score against England all-rounder Ben Stokes. However, he was not given out on review, and a frustrated Stokes appeared to exchange words with Samuels as they left the field for tea. Samuels insisted that the altercation had no effect on him, adding that it only reminded him of a provocative exchange with Anderson in 2012 during their series in England. Samuels added that he enjoys playing under pressure and, in fact, it seems to bring out the best in him. This was evident in his play on day one, as he shared a stand of 111 for the fourth wicket with Jermaine Blackwood before dominating an unbroken 66-run partnership for the sixth wicket withDowrich. The Jamaican also played a vital role in West Indies' win in the second Test, scoring a patient 103 as the Caribbean side chased down 332 to level the series in Barbados on a thrilling final day. Though England will be familiar with Samuels' danger to them, they would have preferred to see the back of him earlier on day one. Although the tourists picked up regular wickets during the morning session, a sixth-wicket partnership between Samuels and wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich held England at bay. As the duo continues to frustrate the English bowlers, many may question whether Stokes' exchange with Samuels did more harm than good. Nonetheless, it is Samuels who remains unbeaten at the crease and looking to score his seventh Test ton against an England side desperate to end the tour on a high note.", "Person1: Hello.

While two commonly used primers (PB1 and L10) failed to discriminate between some of the different serovars belonging to the same genospecies, this primer was able to generate discriminatory fingerprints for all strains tested. All 20 Leptospira isolates, recovered from patients in Andaman Islands, could also be typed by fingerprints generated with the M16 primer. The discriminatory power of M16 primer adds more specificity to the rapidity of this system of characterization and can be used as an excellent tool in epidemiological studies on Leptospira.", "This is a FANTASTIC film. Hana is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his live fully everyday by teaming up with his friend making pranks on just about everything, even his own death. While his wife can't deal with his \"irresponsible\" behavior, she also knows that it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century. I would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death. He is joyful, witty, mischievous, and never boring. Vlastimil Brodsky brilliantly played Hana at the age of 79. Every look from his eyes and every move from his aging muscles deliver so much about the character to the audience.

However, several studies have established a connection between H. pylori strains carrying the babA2 gene and a higher virulence in various populations. The babA2 gene in H. pylori is responsible for the bacterial adherence to the gastric epithelial cells in the stomach, which is a crucial step in the development of gastric diseases such as gastritis and gastric cancer. Studies have demonstrated that the babA2-positive H. pylori strains are significantly associated with an increased risk of severe gastritis and peptic ulcer diseases, as well as gastric cancer in some populations. Considering the general link between babA2-positive H. pylori strains and increased virulence, it is plausible to expect a similar association among strains from the Indian subpopulation. However, further research and specifically designed ex vivo studies are necessary to establish a definite association between babA2-harboring H. pylori strains from the Indian subpopulation and their virulence.", "Previous clinical testing reported that subjects perceive bright phosphenes (ON responses) and also prefer stimulation rates of 5-7 Hz. Our results suggest that responses of ON cells are weak at high rates of stimulation (7 Hz) due to the reset while responses of OFF cells are strong at low rates (4 Hz) due to reduced desensitization, both reducing the ratio of ON to OFF responses. In combination with previous results indicating that responses in ON cells more closely match physiological patterns (Im and Fried 2015 J.

As a result, generations of Everest climbers have left tons of trash - including tents, oxygen cylinders, and human waste - on the slopes, contributing to environmental degradation and threats to the local ecosystem. In response to the growing problem of waste on the mountain, the Indian army has embarked on an ambitious mission to remove at least 4,000 kilograms of garbage from the peak. The team of Indian soldiers and expert climbers, led by Major General Anindya Sengupta, has been tasked with the arduous responsibility of cleaning-up the \"Roof of the World.\" The first-of-its-kind initiative, dubbed \"Clean Everest,\" started last week and aims to remove waste from not only the 8,848-meter peak but also the trekking route leading up to it. Part of the garbage is expected to be airlifted from the higher altitudes, while the remaining waste will be cleared manually by the team members. \"With each expedition, mountaineers generate a significant amount of trash that often remains there. It's essential that the pristine nature of this location is preserved for future generations,\" said Sengupta. According to a study by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an astonishing 30 tonnes of waste has accumulated on Everest since 1950. In recent years, both the Nepalese government and tourism industry have become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of the waste left behind by climbers. The government of Nepal even introduced a regulation in 2014, requiring all mountaineers to bring back at least 8 kilograms of their waste, failing which they can be penalized. But despite these efforts, cleaning up the slopes remains a daunting task. The Indian army's \"Clean Everest\" drive is expected to last for up to six weeks, with members working in staggered groups to carry out the cleanup process. They have already recovered several tents, oxygen cylinders, abandoned ropes, and large bags of trash. The mission also plans to recover the bodies of climbers who perished on their ascent, with the permission of their families. Through this initiative, the Indian army seeks not only to preserve the environment but also to pay tribute to the mountaineers who lost their lives attempting the climb. Cleaning Everest is expected to be an ongoing effort, and if the Indian army is successful, it could inspire other nations to take up similar initiatives. As the world continues to enjoy the majesty of this natural wonder, efforts like the Indian Army's \"Clean Everest\" mission are vital to ensuring that future generations can appreciate the mountain in all its glory.", "PCR study demonstrated that there was no significant association between the distribution of babA2 genotype or of triple positive strains and disease outcome in this sub population. The adherence assay showed that there was no significant difference in the extent of adherence to AGS cells among babA2 positive and negative strains. But the ex vivo study indicated that the triple positive or even the babA2 only positive strains are involved in increased virulence. The wild type strains also exhibited increased virulence compared to the babA2 mutant strains.

According to sources, the club's management has expressed a keen interest in the Japan tour, which will include exhibition matches with local teams. Chelsea's visit is also expected to boost the sport's popularity among Japanese fans. The proposed tour would allow the English Premier League team to further expand its global fan base, creating new opportunities for commercial partnerships and collaborations with Japanese sponsors. However, the pre-season tour could face some obstacles, as several Chelsea players are expected to be called up for international duty in June. The club will need to liaise with their international counterparts to work out the best possible schedule that doesn't conflict with the players' commitments. The club's priority remains the players' welfare and ensuring they have adequate time for rest and recovery before the start of the new season. [Insert quote from a source: \"It's a fantastic opportunity for Chelsea to connect with their Japanese fans and showcase the team in Asia. There are many details to be worked out regarding the schedule, but the club is committed to making this tour a reality. If the pre-season tour to Japan materializes, it will not be the first time that Chelsea has ventured to Asia. In previous years, the club has participated in the International Champions Cup in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. A definitive decision on the tour's feasibility is yet to be made, as Chelsea must still coordinate with Japanese officials and other relevant parties. Fans can expect further updates as details become available. In conclusion, if the tour to Japan goes ahead, it will be an exciting opportunity for Chelsea to expand its global fan base and establish strong ties with the Japanese market, while providing the team with an unforgettable pre-season experience.", "Headline: Everton Goalkeeper Tim Howard Joins Wheelchair Football Team Training Session Everton Goalkeeper Tim Howard showed his support for wheelchair football by joining the Everton in the Community's (EITC) team for a training session at Croxteth Sports Centre recently.

Corriere dello Sportclaim that Juve have a plan in place to sign the in-demand Uruguayan as they look to partner him with fellow South American Carlos Tevez. Cavani, who played for Italian sides Palermo and Napoli before joining PSG in a 50million deal in 2013, has admitted his frustration at being played out of position under Laurent Blanc. PSG striker Edinson Cavani (left) is a target for Juventus according to Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport . Manchester United also hold an interest in Cavani, pictured in action against Marseille last weekend . He told Canal Plus: 'The only concern that I have ever spoken about is that I was recruited to play as a striker with (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic and it has not always been the case. 'There is a long series of games where I have not scored in Ligue 1 but that can happen. In France, people judge me as a lone striker, but I do not play in that position.' Former Manchester United boss David Moyes attempted to sign Cavani before he joined PSG and the Old Trafford club remain interested in acquiring him when the transfer window reopens. Louis van Gaal is hoping to bring two new strikers to Old Trafford this summer with Radamel Falcao unlikely to turn his loan move into a permanent one and Robin van Persie being eyed by both Juve and Inter Milan. United appear to have an advantage over Juventus in their pursuit of Cavani after the player's agent, Claudio Anelucci, admitted that a move to England or Spain was most likely. Cavani (left) has admitted that he is concerned about playing out of position under Laurent Blanc (right) Cavani's agentClaudio Anelucci says his client is most likely to move to England or Spain this summer . He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Is Cavani on the market? At this point it's a little early to say. 'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' 'Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe. 'The market would seem to suggest Spain or England - we can't say at the present time that an Italian club could participate in the bidding for Cavani.'", "After years of hoping he would rip opposition defences to shreds, Pep Guardiola has admitted he has to start trying to work out a way to stop Lionel Messi. On the prospect of facing the greatest player in Barcelona's history, Guardiola - the greatest coach the club has had - said: 'We will have to see what we can do in each of the two games and we will try to create the best defensive system possible to stop Messi. 'They are a wonderful team but so are we,' said the Bayern Munich boss. Pep Guardiola will be reintroduced to Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals . The Bayern Munich coach must think of a way to stop the superb Lionel Messi next month . Guardiola goes back to Barcelona with the team now coached by Luis Enrique playing their best football since he left the club in 2012. 'It will be a very special game for me,' he said after the teams were drawn to face each other. 'It will also be special for Thiago [Alcantara] and for the rest of the coaching staff. I lived my whole life in Barcelona, it' s my home.' Guardiola nurtured Messi into the best player in the world while manager at the Nou Camp . Guardiola showed how much the club still means to him when alongside his father he watched them beat Manchester City in the last 16, cheering them on from the stands of the Nou Camp. He did little to hide his appreciation for Messi that night and admitted that the four-times Ballon d'Or winner could punish Bayern if they are as sloppy as they were in the first leg against Porto in the quarter-finals. They went down 3-1 before hammering the Portuguese outfit 6-1 in Bavaria. He said: 'If we make the same mistakes then the tie will be all over in Barcelona.'", "I just viewed Jean Renoir's wonderful film, French Can Can. This 1955 masterpiece tells the story of Danglard, played by Jean Gabin, a theater owner who revives the forgotten art of the cancan dance in late 19th century Paris. The film is an extravagant and colorful celebration of the Moulin Rouge era, and captures the vivacity and decadence of its time. Renoir's direction is nothing short of pure genius, as he creates a dazzling spectacle of dance sequences combined with an engaging plot. The film is filled with both elaborate costumes and scenic designs, effectively immersing the viewer in the rich culture of the period. The performances by the ensemble cast, including Gabin, Francoise Arnoul, and Maria Felix, are equally impressive, filled with passionate intensity and commitment to their roles. Another standout aspect is the music, which will have you humming along to the infectious tunes long after the end credits roll. The film's centerpiece, the iconic cancan dance sequence, is a thrilling and perfectly choreographed piece that serves as a testament to the film's lasting impact on cinema history. In conclusion, French Can Can is a cinematic gem that showcases Renoir's incredible talent as a filmmaker. Its rich story, captivating characters, and stunning visuals make it an unforgettable film that should not be missed. Whether you're a fan of classic cinema or just looking for an entertaining and visually stunning movie, French Can Can is a must-see.", "Headline: Celebrities Embrace Power of Pink in SpringSummer Collections Subhead: Holly Willoughby, Katherine Jenkins, and Samantha Cameron sport various shades of pink, symbolizing confidence, energy, and power.

Using in vitro degradation assays, both Dsg1 and Dsg2 could be readily proteolyzed by hK7, which is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The enforced expression of hK7 in BxPC-3 cells that express significant amounts of Dsg2 resulted in a marked increase in the shedding of soluble Dsg2, which is consistent with the notion that aberrant expression of hK7 in pancreatic tumors may result in diminished cell-cell adhesion and facilitate tumor cell invasion.", "This film has the language, the style and the attitude down ... plus greats rides from Occy (a world champ) and the great Jerry Lopez.

The character i liked most of all was Kronk, so i was thrilled when i heard of the sequel (sp) featuring non other than \"Kronk.\"I just watched Kronk's New groove, it took me two days because i had to shut it off, i was so bored halfway through it. I finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first.Being a Disney film, i was expecting to have some musical scenes, however this one was filled with them and they were not amusing. The great thing i found about Emperors New Groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. Kronks New Groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first. It is really aimed towards young children, the comedy is pretty childish, the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely corny.Save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worthy of a second viewing. I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was. They actually managed to make a character (Kronk) not funny in this film, that is amazing in itself.Obviously every ones opinion differs but i am very easily amused, i usually enjoy sequels (sp) even when others discredit them, mostly because i loved the first so much i needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was i would enjoy the film. I cannot say the same for this one, i never would have thought i would be turning it off half way through due to pure boredom.Buy at Own Risk.", "Massachusetts Senator Slams Washington for Serving Special Interests Washington, D.C - The Massachusetts senator criticized the current political climate in Washington, stating that the political system caters to special interests and well-connected individuals, leaving out the rest of the nation from its decision-making process. In an interview with local reporters, the senator called for changes in Washington's corrupt political culture, asserting that voters deserve better representation. She was particularly critical of the Republican Party, saying that two declared GOP candidates had already disqualified themselves in her eyes. The senator did not name specific candidates, but her statement has raised concerns for some on the right. The senator believes that the majority of the American people are fed up with politics as usual and believe that the government serves the interests of a select few, rather than their constituents. She said, \"It's time for a change in the way politics work 'inside the Beltway'. It's time for politicians to stand up for what's right and to put the interests of the American people first.\" She urged voters to educate themselves about the various political candidates and to demand political transparency from their elected officials. She also stressed the importance of campaign finance reform to reestablish a democracy that works for everyone, not just the elite few. \"In order to tackle the status quo, we need politicians who are willing to put the interests of their constituents before their own political ambitions,\" the senator concluded. It remains unclear how this statement will affect the GOP candidates or the senator's own political prospects. However, her remarks have ignited a conversation on the role that special interests play in American politics and the need for systemic change in Washington.", "A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December - but didn't have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: 'I stopped because I couldn't see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.' Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner's Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to 'use an ATM' before making a run for it. 'The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi - I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,' Mr Robinson told the inquest. 'Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.' Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out. Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: 'It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. 'There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.' Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend's house but he and his friends didn't have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by 'dodging' the fare.

Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered .", "Spoiler Ahead I suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for TV movie, but this one was especially bad. The plot was a good idea, but badly done, the acting wasn't especially good. The storyline revolved around a young woman discovering her hidden supernatural powers in a small town. However, the execution was painful to watch. The dialogue was awkward and forced, making the character interactions cringe-worthy. The special effects were subpar, not aiding in the already weak storyline. Instead of adding excitement to the action scenes, the effects seemed to only serve as a distraction. The movie had potential for thrilling and suspenseful moments, but ultimately fell flat. The characters were underdeveloped and lacked depth, leading to audiences having a hard time connecting with their struggles. Instead of being invested in the story, viewers found themselves not caring about the outcome or rooting for any of the characters. It was truly disappointing considering the potential in the plot. The acting left a lot to be desired, with actors seemingly overacting or underacting in every scene. It felt like watching a high school play rather than a professionally produced movie. Their performances were unconvincing, failing to add any emotional weight to the story. Overall, this made for TV movie had potential but was completely let down by its poor execution, acting, and special effects. It is a prime example of a good idea gone bad and serves as a lesson in the importance of proper character development and engaging storytelling. Save yourself the time and pass on this one.", "Police have dramatically arrested a 27-year-old man who tried to flee the area after officers found a woman's body in the boot of the car he was driving.

The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live see how I get on. Should I? comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's 'comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in the Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison. Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy. Incoming ECB chairman Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Alastair Cook (left) was coy on Pietersen's chances of a recall but Peter Moores said he 'isn't on the radar' Moores was previously dismissed as England coach at the behest of Pietersen when he was captain . He was then belittled as a nagging 'woodpecker' in the the batsman's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch. Asked at Gatwick about the situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.' He would, therefore, seem an unlikely viewer of Pietersen's Periscope net session.", "Person1: There are so many environmental problems in the world today.

Mrs. Obama shared that she hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years and that allowing Malia to drive gives her a sense of normalcy, helping her feel more like her friends who are also driving. The former First Lady was on Rachael Ray's talk show to discuss various topics, including her new book, \"Becoming,\" and life after the White House. One light-hearted moment in the conversation occurred when Mrs. Obama told Ray about how her eldest daughter, Malia, learned to drive. The process of teaching Malia to drive understandably involved a few unique challenges, given the family's high profile. Michelle explained that in an effort to maintain some normalcy in her daughter's life, Secret Service agents had stepped in to teach her how to drive. \"I haven't driven in about seven or eight years because, obviously, we had drivers in the White House,\" Mrs. Obama said, adding that driving had always been a pleasurable pastime for her. When it came to teaching Malia to drive, Michelle said that she wasn't too concerned about her daughter's safety, thanks to the Secret Service agents' expert instruction. \"My kids had the opportunity to learn from some of the best drivers in the world,\" she proudly stated. Michelle also talked about how important it was for Malia to have the experience of driving, saying that it helped her feel like a normal teenager. \"It's something that every teenager looks forward to, getting that first driver's license. It's a sense of freedom and independence, and we wanted Malia to have that experience despite our unique circumstances.\" Malia was quick to embrace her newfound freedom, with Mrs. Obama sharing a story about her daughter sneaking out to drive around the neighborhood in their new car. \"I think she was just so excited to be able to drive that she couldn't help herself,\" she joked, expressing appreciation for the prudence and discretion of the Secret Service during such moments. Michelle Obama's candid conversation with Rachael Ray offered a unique glimpse into the lives of the former FirstFamily, particularly how they've worked to maintain a sense of normalcy for their children. Malia's driving lessons with the Secret Service agents demonstrate that even amid extraordinary circumstances, the Obamas continue to prioritize their daughters' well-being and happiness.", "After a couple years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart film, \"Two Against the World,\" it unexpectedly showed up as a TCM offering under the title \"One Fatal Hour,\" a First National film from 1936. The moment the opening credits rolled with Bogart's name, my heart raced with anticipation. Thankfully, the film did not disappoint. \"One Fatal Hour\" showcases Bogart as a charming and crafty socialite named Sherry Scott, who undertakes the challenge of managing a struggling radio station. The film delves into the world of the 1930s radio business while serving as a commentary on sensationalist journalism, which resonates even today. The narrative revolves around a death row inmate who is about to be executed and the lengths to which the radio station goes to boost its ratings by exploiting the situation. Bogart's performance is gripping yet nuanced, as he works diligently to save the radio station while navigating both the professional and personal pitfalls in his life. The supporting cast members, including Beverly Roberts as Alma Ross and Linda Perry as Jerry Crane, deliver outstanding performances and add depth to the overall storyline. \"One Fatal Hour\" is a riveting snapshot of a bygone era, and its message about the dangers of sensationalism and unscrupulous journalism remains pertinent to our times. The film's tight pacing, engaging script, and stellar performances make it a forgotten gem that Bogart fans and classic movie lovers alike should not miss. While the film may have gone under the radar for several years, its rediscovery is a testament to the timeless quality of good storytelling and superb acting. Overall, \"One Fatal Hour\" is a thrilling rollercoaster ride that will equally delight and challenge audiences.", "Britain's Adam Peaty has broken the men's 100 metres breast stroke world record with a time of 57.92 seconds at the London Aquatic Centre.

British swimmer Adam Peaty is all smiles after setting a new world record for the 100m breast stroke . His time of 57.92 seconds has beaten the previous record of 58.46 set by Cameron van der Burgh in 2012 . Peaty has spoken of his delight that his hard work and training have paid off and is thrilled with the win . After becoming the first man in history to break through the 58-second barrier in the discipline, Peaty said: 'I can't believe it, coming in earlier I thought I could get a really good time, maybe a 58.5. 'Before that race I just thought I've done all the training for a 57, and it all paid off in the end. 'The crowd were great and they really carried me home at the end, because that was a hell of a pain train. There must be something in that lane four when it really matters.' Scotland's Ross Murdoch fought hard but was left trailing in Peaty's wake with a time of 59.12 - still inside the World Championship qualification standard - while James Wilby of Loughborough took bronze with a 1:00.31.

In the women's competition, Fran Halsall stormed to victory in the open 50m freestyle.

This film turns the concept of a traditional horror movie on its head by placing the story in a seemingly innocuous setting. The radio host, brilliantly portrayed by Jack Clark, keeps his listeners gripped as they share tales of conspiracy theories, mysterious happenings, and general paranoia. Little does he know that one of their calls will lead to unspeakable horror. As the chilling night unfolds, the ominous atmosphere builds tension, making the audience feel as though they are in the radio station alongside the host. The dialogue is witty and engaging, and the characters - ranging from the passionate conspiracy theorist to the casual listener - are charming and relatable. The cinematography effectively uses shadows and light contrasts to create a dark, claustrophobic environment which only heightens the fear factor. The true highlight of Dead Silence is its approach to the zombie outbreak. Unlike typical zombie movies, the undead in this film are just as terrifying in their subtlety. Instead of an over-the-top gore fest, Dead Silence expertly utilizes suspense and psychological fear, which only serves to heighten the dread. The zombies are the menacing presence that you know are creeping closer, even when they're not on the screen. The terror grips you as the characters realize the horrifying reality of the situation and must decide whether to fight or flee. The performances are strong across the board, with Jack Clark stealing the show as the initially skeptical radio host who must grapple with the horrifying situation. He brings both humor and raw emotion to his role, making his character easy to root for. The supporting actors are also commendable, each adding depth to their roles and delivering a well-rounded ensemble performance. While there are moments when the pacing could have been tightened and a few minor plot holes are noticeable, overall, Dead Silence proves to be a refreshing take on the zombie genre, making it a must-watch for horror fans. The film effectively weaves together elements of suspense, fear, and dark humor without going overboard, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats until the final, heart-stopping scene. In conclusion, Dead Silence takes an intriguing concept and delivers a thrilling, chilling, and utterly entertaining movie experience. If you're a fan of the zombie genre, or even just in the mood for a good, spine-tingling scare, this film is definitely worth your time.

He's done High School Musical, but he can't coast along on that so now he's making appearances on other Disney shows'. Personally, I love The Suite Life and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason, I'm not too keen on Zac Efron, although all my friends think he's the best thing since Jesse McCartney. But he really annoys me. Anyway, I watched the show (taking a break from English coursework) and was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good all round, especially from the regular characters on The Suite Life, and Zac Efron wasn't as bad as I had anticipated. All in all, a pretty good show.", "Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc admitted that Barcelona were superior to his side 'in virtually every department' as he saw his team slump to a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of the quarter-final at the Parc des Princes. An early strike from Neymar and second-half brace from Luis Suarez sealed victory for Barcelona and placed the Catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended Marco Verratti and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while PSG were also unable to start with David Luiz and saw Thiago Silva hobble off in the early stages. Luis Suarez eases past David Luiz en route to scoring his second goal of the Champions League tie . Gerard Pique leads the celebrations after Barcelona secured a 3-1 victory in Paris on Wednesday night . 'I'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted,' said Blanc. 'I'm not doing that. We put a team out there, but we were dominated by Barcelona. 'It's only six days until the second leg, with a league game in between, so it's a 'short week' for people to recover. I think Barcelona were fitter than us. We had players who weren't at 100 per cent, and also a lot of absentees, but that should have been a motivation for us. We never controlled the ball well enough, and Barca were better than us in virtually every department. 'We will have the suspended players back next week, and that is an incentive. We'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight. They were better than us tonight and scored three goals. We'll try and show a different PSG at Barcelona next week. Hopefully we will achieve a different result.' Laurent Blanc made no excuses for his side as they now face elimination from the Champions League . David Luiz, who started the game from the substitutes' bench, endured a night to forget in the French capital . In the end, the Frenchman was relieved to escape only 3-1 down. 'It didn't end up as bad as it might have done, but the players are very disappointed with the way it went,' he said. 'We gave the impression we gave Barcelona the kind of game they wanted to pay. They made life difficult for us on the counter-attack and have players who can be very dangerous.' Barcelona manager Luis Enrique was delighted with his side's showing and reserved special praise for Suarez. 'Suarez is special in his own way,' Enrique said, 'Look at the goals he scored for Ajax and Liverpool. He is very strong and finishes so well. But it wasn't just about Luis Suarez tonight.

Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, has already seen three players - including Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero - diagnosed. The Peruvian forward is reportedly recovering well, but until now, Guerrero has been unable to train with his team or take part in matches. His absence is a significant blow for Corinthians, who have been suffering from irregular football results in the last couple of months. Medical teams across Brazil have been put on high alert due to the increasing spread of the disease, especially in Sao Paulo, where 43,000 people have been affected by the disease in the first quarter of the year. In total, there have been 224,000 confirmed cases of dengue fever in Brazil in 2021, a worrying increase from the 170,000 in 2020. Apart from Guerrero, players from Fluminense and Athletico Paranaense have also been diagnosed with dengue fever. Fluminense defender Fernando Pacheco and Athletico Paranaense winger Nikao are reportedly recovering well, but their return to the pitch remains uncertain. The outbreak of the fever has sparked fear among clubs, forcing players, coaching staff and fans to take extra precautions to avoid the proliferation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is the primary vector for the dengue virus. Medical practitioners are also monitoring the players' health closely, and providing guidelines and assistance to help mitigate the outbreak. The clubs, stadiums, and practice facilities are taking action to combat the outbreak, by implementing mosquito-repellent measures and educating staff and fans about dengue fever. This includes distributing pamphlets, dispensing insect repellent to players and fans, and making concerted efforts to eradicate any standing water that acts as mosquito breeding grounds on and around club premises. Despite the best efforts of the clubs, there remains a concern that the outbreak may force changes to the upcoming fixture schedule, with the potential for match delays and even cancellations arising due to the ongoing health crisis. Brazil is not the only country where dengue fever has impacted football; the disease had previously jeopardized the 2018 World Cup qualifying match between Nigeria and Tahiti. With many Brazilian clubs set to participate in international competitions soon, officials are hoping to contain the outbreak quickly to avoid a disruption in the international football calendar. The spread of dengue fever serves as an unwelcome reminder of another public health crisis that has impacted football globally - the COVID-19 pandemic. Brazilian football, much like the rest of the world, is currently recovering from the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sport and national economy. With the dengue fever outbreak adding to an already challenging situation, clubs, players, and fans are eagerly hoping for a swift resolution.", "What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this?

Liana Barrientos, a 39-year-old woman from the Bronx, was re-arrested after a court appearance for alleged fare beating. Prosecutors say that Barrientos had married ten men in a sophisticated immigration scam. She pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges on Friday. According to prosecutors, Barrientos had married ten men from various countries between 1999 and 2010, collecting fees in exchange for helping the men to obtain legal US residency. Most of the marriages were to men from \"red-flagged\" countries that have large populations of individuals who pose national security or public safety risks, prosecutors said. In some instances, Barrientos had two husbands at once and married multiple times in a short period. For example, she married her seventh husband in February 2002 and her eighth husband just over two weeks later. In all, she married men from Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan, Mali, and Bangladesh. The scam was brought to the attention of authorities in February 2010 when Department of Homeland Security agents arrested a man from the Bronx who was attempting to board a plane to Yemen on a US passport obtained through a fraudulent marriage to Barrientos. She was originally arrested in 2013 for falsifying documents but was released; however, she never showed up for her court date. This time, the alleged scammer was arrested outside the Bronx Supreme Court for fare evasion. Investigators believe they have recovered over 50,000 in payments obtained from foreign immigrants by Barrientos. On Friday, Barrientos appeared for her court-ordered mental health examination, following a judge's order in June for psychiatric evaluation. Her attorney argued that Barrientos suffered from serious mental health issues and had a history of substance abuse. The judge ordered further evaluations to determine whether she could stand trial. If convicted on the felony charges related to the immigration scam, Barrientos could face significant fines and imprisonment. Meanwhile, authorities continue to investigate the extent of the scam and stated that further arrests could be made.", "A 10-year-old boy has been rushed to hospital after being shot in the stomach by a person attempting to kill an aggressive dog.

There are two main types of ruptures: contained ruptures and free ruptures. Contained rupture: In this type, the leaking blood is contained within the surrounding tissue, leading to a more stable hemodynamic situation. Patients with a contained rupture have better chances of survival, with a higher likelihood of reaching the hospital and undergoing successful emergency surgery. Free rupture: In this type, the blood freely escapes into the abdominal cavity, leading to sudden and severe internal bleeding. This can quickly lead to hemodynamic instability, shock, and death. Patients with free ruptures have a much worse prognosis, with a significant number of individuals dying before reaching the hospital. In addition to the type of rupture, several other factors can also influence outcomes for rAAA patients. This includes factors such as patient age, overall health, comorbidities, the size of the aneurysm, extent of rupture, the time from rupture to treatment, and the quality of surgical and medical management.", "Poundland has been been forced to pull decorative plastic Easter Eggs from their shelves over fears children may choke - because they look like Cadbury Mini Eggs.

MSLLs are a method for generating reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) libraries, which allow for the targeted enrichment of CpG-rich regions in the genome. This method can improve the efficiency of gene-enriched sequencing in complex genomes by specifically targeting regions of interest, allowing for better resolution and coverage of biologically significant regions like gene promoters and regulatory elements. Additionally, since MSLLs incorporate bisulfite treatment during library preparation, they can also provide information on DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution. By incorporating this information, researchers can gain insights into epigenetic regulation and potentially identify methylation domains, which can lead to better understanding of gene regulation and genomic stability in complex genomes. In summary, MSLLs provide a powerful tool to enhance gene-enriched sequencing of complex genomes and provide valuable information on DNA methylation, helping to advance our understanding of epigenetic regulation in various organisms and biological processes.", "71-year-old man trapped in car seat, family captures hilarious moment on video A 71-year-old man from Portland, Clint Chadbourne, became an overnight sensation after a video of him trapped in a car seat was posted online by his family. The video quickly went viral, accumulating thousands of views and leaving the internet in stitches. The incident occurred when Clint was on his way home with his family. His wife Bonnie and daughter Kelly were also in the car and decided to capture the hilarious moment on camera. In the video, Clint is seen struggling to free himself from the confines of what appears to be a child's car seat. Remarkably, Clint did not panic despite being trapped in the seat, but instead became increasingly agitated as his family's laughter continued to grow. The Chadbournes can be heard in the video relentlessly teasing Clint, with one family member saying, \"I've seen it all now - you and a car seat.\" Eventually, the family was able to free Clint from his predicament, and he made light of the situation with a joke. He told his family, \"I'm going on a diet.\" After the ordeal was over, the Chadbournes decided to share their hilarious car seat adventure with friends and family on Facebook. Little did they know that the video would become an instant hit and give Clint his 15 minutes of fame. While the family had found the situation comical, they never expected it to go viral. Facebook users were quick to share the video, praising Clint for his refreshing sense of humor and positive attitude despite being trapped.

The comments were made during a documentary that aired on April 12th, the anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's historic first spaceflight in 1961. In the film, Maidanovich provided no evidence for his claim, nor did he name the country that he believes is behind the ruse. However, he expressed concern that such an act would compromise global security and space traffic management. \"Someone is hiding satellites in what seems like space junk, but these satellites can perform specific tasks,\" Maidanovich said. \"These satellites are not for research or exploration purposes - they are for military purposes.\" The commander's remarks have sparked international interest as countries continue to expand their presence in outer space. The claim comes amid growing concerns over the increasing amount of space debris orbiting the Earth. According to the European Space Agency (ESA), there are more than 34,000 objects larger than 10 cm in size currently orbiting Earth at high speeds, posing a potential hazard to satellites and spacecraft. Such a statement from a high-ranking Russian military official raises questions about the possibility of a new space arms race, and adds further evidence to the argument that space is becoming an increasingly contested and militarized domain. Satellite warfare has already become an integral part of many nations' military strategies. In 2019, India successfully tested an anti-satellite missile, while the United States established its Space Force as a new branch of the military in the same year. Despite the ongoing militarization of space, the international community has made efforts to maintain a cooperative environment through initiatives such as the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. These global efforts, however, could be threatened by growing distrust and accusations of covert activities, like the one made by Maidanovich. Experts argue that countries should engage in a multilateral dialogue in order to develop framework agreements and international norms regarding outer space activities. Without such efforts, the potential for conflict and the likelihood of accidental collisions in space could rapidly increase. As of now, it remains unclear if Maidanovich's accusations will be investigated further or whether any evidence will be made public. The documentary's release on the anniversary of Gagarin's first space flight serves as a reminder of both the rapid advancement and the increasingly precarious nature of human activities in space.", "Yes, old divergences in boreal birds can support the hypothesis that these species could have survived through the Ice Ages. Boreal birds typically inhabit the cold, coniferous forest habitats that were present during the ice ages. Genetic studies showing deep divergence between different populations or lineages of these birds can provide evidence for long-term survival and adaptation to these conditions. During the Ice Ages, boreal forests were able to persist in specific refugia, which were areas of suitable habitat that remained ice-free. Boreal bird populations that survived in these refugia could have been isolated from other populations, resulting in genetic divergence over time. Evidence of this divergence supports the idea that these bird populations were able to survive the harsh conditions of the Ice Ages. However, it is essential to consider that old genetic divergences are not definitive proof of long-term survival through the Ice Ages. Other factors, such as changes in habitat or competition with other species, could also play a role in shaping genetic variation in these bird populations. Further research, including understanding more about the specific adaptations that these birds possess that allow them to survive in cold environments, would be needed to support this hypothesis conclusively.", "Yes, a Gossypium BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) clone can contain key repeat components that distinguish sub-genomes of allotetraploid cottons. Allotetraploid cottons, like Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense, have two distinct sub-genomes (A and D) due to hybridization between diploid A-genome and D-genome ancestors. These sub-genomes can have differences in their repetitive elements, such as transposons (mobile genetic elements) and other sequence repeats. BAC clones are large DNA fragments containing individual genes or gene regions that are stably maintained in bacterial cells. These clones can be used to study specific genes or genomic regions in detail. By analyzing BAC clones derived from different sub-genomes in allotetraploid cottons, researchers can identify and characterize the repeat components that distinguish the A and D sub-genomes. This information can help improve our understanding of the evolutionary history, genome organization, and functional divergence of allotetraploid cotton species.", "I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy.

Furthermore, the gut environment, especially pH, plays a key role in determining the outcome of interspecies competition. This makes it crucial to put greater effort into identifying the range of bacteria that may be stimulated by a given prebiotic approach. Both for reasons of efficacy and of safety, the development of prebiotics intended to benefit human health has to take account of the highly individual species profiles that may result.", "Yes, holoparasitic Rafflesiaceae are known for possessing highly reduced endophytes, meaning they have lost many features of typical plants, such as leaves, roots, and chlorophyll, as they completely rely on their hosts for nutrition. Despite their reduced structure, they give rise to the world's largest flowers, such as Rafflesia arnoldii, which can reach up to a meter in diameter and weigh up to 11 kilograms.", "I picked this DVD up for 3.99 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free. I never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the DVD player. The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. Some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy. The acting is really cheesy in some parts, and the \"action\" scenes are completely laughable. You'll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained. The plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot, not that there really is a plot at all.Don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover, there are not 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes.As for the DVD, there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film, a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train, and the deleted scenes are really pointless, if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad. There is also a really bad making of featurette which doesn't really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots. I can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends. I give it 2 kitty cats out of 5.", "In 1968 when, \"SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One,\" was released, it came from out of nowhere, and struck like a psychedelic thunder bolt. Afro-American actor and film maker, William Greaves, aimed to forever alter the 'news-reel' style of documentary film-making, and to this day, there has never been anything quite like it. The movie is a film about 'the making of a film', and intentionally written and directed so as to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. Set in New York's Central Park, the action and scant dialog concern a couple who fight and bicker about homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants out of the relationship, and the man wants an explanation. Near the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless man interrupts the proceedings and offers his commentary, and personal back-story. Then, after the principle footage has been shot, the film crew add their own views of the film-maker and what they feel is his inept handling of the movie. And during the entire film, multiple cameras are employed to record the action within the scene, and extraneous commentary by cast, crew, and onlookers. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in Avant Garde film makers such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes, or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves attempts to show that a thing cannot be truly observed and understood because the viewing itself would alter the reality. \"SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One\" can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of The Uncertainty Principle. This is only one possible explanation, and Greave's true intent is certainly open for speculation. Above all else, this film seeks to confound, confront. and stimulate, and without a doubt, succeeds admirably.", "I just viewed Jean Renoir's wonderful film, French Can Can. It is a visual delight and a great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison. I didn't quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received. Now I'm convinced more than ever, that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast, and the great French actor, Jean Gabin was in rare form. The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one I'd ever seen. It was long, but I didn't want it to end. This film deserves to receive more recognition than it's got.", "Person1: Of course, that's what I'm here for. Can you please let me know the issue you're facing or the assistance you require?", "Oh, Yawn. That's the only way to summarize my experience watching \"The Unending Monotony,\" a film that, ironically, succeeds in delivering just that. The premise itself was promising: a group of individuals trying to break free from the confines of their mundane lives. However, the execution falls flat, descending into cliches and flimsy character development. From the very first scene, the sluggish pacing drags the audience into a numbing sense of boredom, making it an unbearable watch. The director, whose attempt at capturing the ennui and soullessness of modern life, inadvertently makes the audience victims of the same. This is supported by the uninspired cinematography, which fails to elevate even potentially beautiful shots. The acting does little to save the film - the lifeless performances of the ensemble cast seem more like a consequence of the weak script and uninspired direction. Dialogues, filled with faux profundity, do nothing but induce an eye-roll. Instead of instilling empathy or understanding, it leaves the viewers questioning if perhaps the audio was better off muted. The score of the film can best be described as obtrusively generic - each note doing nothing to enhance the viewer's experience but rather leaves a lingering feeling of annoyance. Overall, \"The Unending Monotony\" is a film that fails to make good on its intriguing premise, and instead turns out to be a self-indulgent exercise in cinematic soul-crushing lethargy. My only solace is that, thankfully, the movie does come to an end.", "There is limited research available on the association between genetic variation in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor and chronic musculoskeletal complaints in adolescents. While some studies have suggested associations between genetic polymorphisms and various musculoskeletal conditions, such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and low back pain, these studies typically focus on adult populations. In a study by Holmen et al. (2011), they found a modest association between a specific polymorphism of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) and musculoskeletal pain in a group of adolescents. However, this study did not specifically focus on chronic musculoskeletal complaints, and the authors acknowledge that further studies are needed to explore this association. Overall, the connection between genetic variation in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor and chronic musculoskeletal complaints in adolescents remains uncertain, and more research is needed to clarify this relationship.", "The TPEF signal of elastin was increased at the peripheral regions of LCs (10 m) compared with foam cell regions. In order to confirm the increase of elastin, biochemical assay (western blot) was performed. The protein level of elastin was increased approximately 2.25-fold (p 0.024) in LC-rich arteries. Under the hypothesis that the increase of elastin resulted from the mechanical stimulus from solid-state LCs, MNLO images were subjected to FEA to simulate the displacement according to the expanding magnitude of the vessel during cardiac cycles. We found that microscale focal stress was increased specifically around the LCs. These FEA results corresponded with the increase of elastin observed by TPEF. These data suggest that LCs mechanically stimulate the adjacent ECM to alter the composition of ECM and cause vessel remodeling. The combination of MNLO imaging and FEA has great potential to verify the mechanical predictions in cardiovascular diseases.", "A man charged with assassinating Russian opposition leader Boris Nemstov has told a court he was beaten and pressured into confessing to the murder. Zaur Dadaev is accused of being involved in the shooting of the politician in Moscow on February 27, along with four other Chechan men. Now Russian news agencies have quoted him as telling the court that he had been abducted, beaten and pressured into confessing to Nemstov's murder. Zaur Dadaev spoken to the court in Moscow via a video link from his prison cell. Dadaev had previously confessed to Boris Nemstov's murder but now says he was beaten and pressured into make that statement . Dadaev is one of five Chechan men who have been accused of killing the opposition leader. Nemstov was shot in the back four times on a bridge close to the Kremlin in February, sparking a huge protest march in Moscow . Dadaev was the only one, according to a judge and investigators, who confessed to the killing. When he appeared in court in March, Dadaev didn't admit his guilt for the murder, and later retracted his confession. Human rights activist Andrei Babushkin, who visited the suspect in jail last month, said he had seen signs of torture on Dadaev's body. Zaur Dadaev retracted his confession for the murder of Nemstov last month. A human rights activist said when he visited him in prison he had abrasions on his body and had suffered multiple injuries . Boris Nemstov was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is understood at the time of his death he was working on a report examining Russia's military involvement in the east of Ukraine . But the Russian state-funded television network Russia Today claimed human rights activists had found no signs of torture on Dadaev's body when they visited him in custody. Dadaev is being held with his cousins, Anzor and Shagid Gubahsev. Khamzat Bakhayev andTamerlan Eskerkhanov have also been accused of involvement in Nemstov's murder. The outspoken politician was shot in the back four times as he crossed a bridge near the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow.

These IOLs attempt to address various issues, such as glare, halos, and reduced contrast sensitivity, that may be associated with earlier multifocal lenses. Here are some updated developments in the field: 1. Alcon AcrySof IQ Vivity IOL: Recently approved by the US FDA, this new IOL uses a non-diffractive design called X-Wave technology, which extends the range of vision without splitting light into multiple distinct focal points. This unique approach may potentially reduce visual disturbances like glare and halos compared to traditional multifocal lenses. 2. Zeiss CT LUCIA 602 IOL: Zeiss introduced this hydrophobic acrylic multifocal lens utilizing a diffractive aspheric design. The lens is designed to perform in varying light conditions and provide spectacle independence, with 80 of patients achieving 2025 vision or better at all distances in a clinical study. 3. Eyhance IOL by Johnson Johnson Vision: This next-generation monofocal IOL provides an extended depth of focus that enhances intermediate vision, aiming to achieve better functional vision across a range of distances. 4. AcuFocus IC-8 IOL: The AcuFocus IC-8 is a small aperture IOL that uses a pinhole effect to increase depth of focus, providing improved vision at near, intermediate, and distance ranges. The FDA approved a clinical trial for this lens in the United States in 2020 for patients undergoing cataract surgery. 5. SIFI Mini Well Ready EDOF IOL: The Mini Well Ready EDOF IOL from SIFI is designed to provide a continuous range of vision from near to distance by merging transitional and refractive zones. This lens may offer improved vision over traditional multifocal lenses with fewer potential visual disturbances. These advancements in multifocal intraocular lenses aim to provide better visual outcomes while minimizing potential side effects. However, it is essential for patients to discuss their individual needs and desired outcomes with their ophthalmologist to determine the most suitable IOL option.", "(i) SR is a potent orally active aquaretic and induces stable effects during 1 week in rats with or without endogenous AVP secretion. (ii) Significant V2 receptor-mediated water reabsorption occurs in collecting ducts of Brattleboro DI rats because their usual urine osmolality is about twofold higher than the minimum observed during SR-induced maximum diuresis. (iii) This V2 agonism could be mediated in part by OT binding to V2 receptors. Small amounts of endogenous AVP, known to be produced by adrenal and testis in DI rats, could also contribute to this V2 agonism, as well as a possible constitutive activation of the V2 receptors. (iv) In normal rats, AVP probably reduces water losses through extrarenal sites, probably the lungs.", "These data demonstrate that apoptosis is an major contributor to neuronal cell death in the early course of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The upregulation of EpoR may be a compensatory response of retinal cells and tissue to diabetic stresses. The EPOEpoR system as a maintenance-survival mechanism of retinal neurons responds to the insults of early diabetes other than ischemia. The protective function of EPOEpoR at the least acts through the EpoR-mediated ERK pathway. Exogenous EPO administration by intravitreal injection in early diabetes may prevent retinal cell death and protect the BRB function. Therefore, this is a novel approach for treatment of early DR.", "I collect films on Super-8, and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on E-bay. This classic black and white film from 1955, called \"Pieces of Time,\" was a highly impressive find. The story follows the lives of three siblings as they grow up in a small midwestern town throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The film's director, Charles Milton, shows his mastery in storytelling through capturing the simple joys, hardships, and small moments that defined the lives of people during that era. While the cast includes some relatively unknown actors of the time, the honest and poignant performances are striking. The chemistry between the siblings is so natural that it's easy to forget they're actors. Jessica Green shines as the eldest sibling, Mary, who uses her wit and charm to provide for her family in the absence of their father. Visually, the film is a joy to watch for cinephiles who love the aesthetic of classic cinema. The black and white imagery lends an air of nostalgia that enhances the emotional depth of the film. Coupled with a brilliant score by Andrew Monroe, the film is a feast for both the eyes and ears. Despite having a runtime of nearly two hours, the film never drags. The well-paced script lends itself to a gripping yet comforting watch. \"Pieces of Time\" is a film that not only entertains but leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. In conclusion, as someone who collects Super-8 films, I can honestly say that finding a full-length print of this film was a true treasure. It's a wonderful addition to my ever-growing collection and is a must-watch for any fan of classic cinema. \"Pieces of Time\" is proof that sometimes the simplest stories can be the most powerful.", "Fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA, researchers have discovered. Dating back hundreds of thousands of years, the instinct to avoid arachnids developed as an evolutionary response to a dangerous threat, the academics suggest. It could mean that arachnophobia, one of the most crippling of phobias, represents a finely tuned survival instinct. And it could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom have existed millions of years ago. Scroll down for video . Researchers say a fear of spiders is a survival trait written into our DNA and dates back thousands of years, Stock photo . Study leader Joshua New, of Columbia University in New York, said: 'A number of spider species with potent, vertebratespecific venoms populated Africa long before hominoids and have co-existed there for tens of millions of years. 'Humans were at perennial, unpredictable and significant risk of encountering highly venomous spiders in their ancestral environments. 'Even when not fatal, a black widow spider bite in the ancestral world could leave one incapacitated for days or even weeks, terribly exposed to dangers,' he told the Sunday Times. The research team carried out an experiment in which 252 volunteers were asked to study computer screens containing abstract shapes and data. Their reactions to images of spiders were very fast, even if their shape was distorted, when compared to much more clear images of other objects known induce disgust or fear, such as needles and flies. The researchers point out that spiders are often small dark creatures that tend to hide in recesses and are hard to spot. Dr New said: 'Detection, therefore, is the critical arbiter of success in such encounters - any improvements to the sensitivity, vigilance, reliability and speed of faculties for their detection would have been of significant selective advantage.' The instinct could date back to early human evolution in Africa, where spiders with very strong venom existed millions of years ago.

One common method used to detect and analyze carbonyl compounds in tree leaves is High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). This technique can be applied to separate, identify, and quantify carbonyl compounds in various samples, including tree leaves. Another method for detecting carbonyl compounds is Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). This technique involves separating the compounds using gas chromatography and then identifying and quantifying the carbonyl compounds based on their mass spectra. These analytical methods can be applied to study carbonyl compounds in tree leaves and other environmental samples globally, including China. The main considerations for collecting and analyzing samples from different locations include proper sample collection, storage, and sample preparation before performing the analysis using the appropriate method.", "Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it.

He becomes suicidal but meets Barbara who changes his ideas for the better. All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside.The movie is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well played out. It's a little sad, somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama. It was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock was doing.

The Islanders have not tasted victory away from home since November 2 when they won 2-0 at AC Milan. Mired in a three-game losing streak following last weekend's 2-1 defeat at home to Milan, Palermo are in 11th place and feeling a sense of urgency to turn things around. Roberto Vitiello (left) feels his side need to start winning away from home and ending their poor record . 'We need to keep working hard in order to defend our Serie A status as soon as possible,' Vitiello said to the Italian press. 'We are disappointed not to have collected anything from our last three league games. 'But we must bounce back. Sunday's game at Udinese is important and we will give our all to clinch our second win on the road this season in Friuli.' Palermo, coached by Giuseppe Iachini, have picked up just two points in their last six league games. Udinese are 13th in the standings and one point adrift of Palermo. Mattia Destro (right) fights for the ball with Vitiello during the Italian Serie A football match Palermo vs Milan . After falling victim to bottom-side Parma in midweek, the Friuli side are vulnerable in their own stadium. Udinese have not won in their last four games and coach Andrea Stramaccioni is desperate for a positive reaction from his players. 'Against Parma, we had the wrong approach to the game,' he said. 'My players underestimated Parma and we paid the price. 'We lacked determination and didn't take a shot on goal. 'Now we must turn the page immediately and show against Palermo, the real Udinese.' Udinese were beaten by bottom-side Udinese last time out as they slip closer to the relegation zone . Udinese have struggled to deliver at home and have mustered just one win in their last nine games at Friuli stadium. The hosts must overcome the absence of defender Ivan Piris and midfielder Giampiero Pinzi, both serving a one-match ban. Palermo are without midfielder Edgar Barreto, who is sidelined for three weeks with a muscular injury. Argentinian forward Paulo Dybala, who is Palermo's top scorer with 13 goals, will lead the Rossaneri's attack on Sunday with Franco Vazquez playing in support. Highly-coveted forward Paulo Dybala will lead the line for Palermo as they look to pick up three points .", "We have discovered that injury to a peripheral nerve and electrical stimulation of C-fibers each cause an increase in the permeability of the BSCB and the BBB. The increase in permeability is delayed in onset, peaks at about 24 hours and is dependent upon action potential propagation. As the increase is mimicked by applying capsaicin to the nerve, the most parsimonious explanation for our findings is that the increase in permeability is mediated by activation of TRPV1-expressing primary sensory neurons. Our findings may be relevant to the development of pain and neuroplastic changes in the CNS following nerve injury. In addition, our findings may provide the basis for developing methods to purposefully open the BBB when needed to increase brain penetration of therapeutic agents that might normally be excluded by an intact BBB.", "I made it through half of this, but was not enough of a masochist to see it all. From the moment this trainwreck of a film started, I knew I was in for a painful viewing experience. The plot tried too hard to be quirky and original, but ultimately fell flatter than a souffle that's been slammed in an oven door. The dialogue felt like it had been written by a high school student trying to impress their English teacher, while the character development was as shallow as a rain puddle in the Sahara Desert. The acting was equally atrocious, with each performer putting forth a cringe-worthy performance that would make even the most amateur of theatergoers writhe in discomfort. It was as if they were all competing to outdo one another in the Most Over-the-Top and Wooden Acting category. I couldn't help but wonder if they were being held against their will, forced to perform in this disaster of a film. As for the cinematography, I can safely say that I've seen children's drawings that possessed more skill and artistic value. Shaky camera work, bizarre angles, and a complete lack of continuity combined to create a visual nightmare that made even the simplest of scenes hard to watch. With all these factors combined, it became apparent that enduring this film in its entirety would be akin to voluntarily submitting oneself to Chinese water torture. Hence, I made the executive decision to escape before I caused lasting damage to my psyche. I implore all of you to avoid this cinematic catastrophe and save yourselves from experiencing the cringefest that is this movie.", "Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. The colorful cast of beloved characters, led by the inimitable Kermit the Frog, takes the audience on a journey through laughter, love, and life lessons while keeping them entertained with catchy tunes and quotable moments. From the moment the film begins, it captures the viewers' attention with its humorous meta-narrative, as Kermit and his friends sit in a movie theater to watch their own adventure unfold. The story that follows is engaging, filled with lovable misfits, zany escapades, and the occasional gentle satire. Characters like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy, each with their own distinct personalities and quirks, endear themselves to the audience and provide a sense of heart and warmth that resonates even when the movie has ended. The film's soundtrack, featuring original music by Paul Williams and Kenny Ascher, is an utter delight, seamlessly blending in with the narrative while generating toe-tapping and sing-along moments. Songs like \"Rainbow Connection\" and \"Movin' Right Along\" are full of whimsy, while others, such as \"I Hope That Something Better Comes Along,\" carry a subtle layer of heartache and wistfulness that appeals to all ages. The puppetry and practical effects in The Muppet Movie are, unsurprisingly, top-notch, a testament to Jim Henson's genius and the creative talents of his team. Far from being dated, the artistry behind the Muppets allows viewers to suspend disbelief and become fully immersed in the world these characters inhabit. The cameo appearances by various celebrities only add to the charm, serving as an enjoyable reminder of The Muppet Show's lasting cultural impact. In summary, The Muppet Movie is a delightful piece of cinema history that continues to captivate audiences with its humor, heart, and undeniable charm. It serves as a beautiful reminder that, while the world may sometimes be chaotic and confusing, there's still room for laughter, friendship, and the belief in the power of dreams.", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics can provide valuable insights into the molecular characteristics of glioblastomas, including the status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification. However, MRI findings may not be definitive in determining EGFR amplification status, as other factors, such as gene mutations, can contribute to imaging features. A study published in 2017 in the American Journal of Neuroradiology showed that specific MRI characteristics, such as the enhancement pattern and the presence of necrosis, were significantly associated with EGFR-amplified glioblastomas. The researchers suggested that combining these MRI features with other clinical factors could improve the prediction of EGFR amplification status. Another study published in 2019 in the journal Cancers found that EGFR-amplified glioblastomas were more likely to have an irregular, thickened enhancement pattern with necrosis and intralesional hemorrhage on MRI. These findings further support the notion that certain MRI characteristics can help predict EGFR amplification status in glioblastoma patients. While these studies support the use of MRI characteristics as a potential non-invasive approach to predict EGFR amplification in glioblastomas, it is essential to remember that MRI findings alone may not provide a definitive answer. Further research is needed to refine predictive models and potentially integrate additional factors, such as molecular profiling and patient demographics, to improve the accuracy of these approaches.", "Seven-year-old British schoolboy's death in the French Alps ruled a tragic accident The tragic death of a seven-year-old British schoolboy, Carwyn Scott-Howell, who fell to his death while skiing in Flaine, France, has been ruled as an accident, according to a state prosecutor. The boy, from Wales, died on April 10 after the accident in the resort of Flaine, where he was skiing for the first time in his life. His body is expected to be brought home this weekend. Witnesses at the scene reported that Carwyn had veered off the piste and was seen falling a short time later. Emergency services were called by his mother, but there was nothing that could be done to save him. Despite initial speculation that Carwyn may have been skiing alone at the time of the accident, state prosecutor Audrey Damnee concluded there was no evidence to suggest the boy was not accompanied by his instructor or a member of his family. \"The Welsh schoolboy, Carwyn Scott-Howell, who died following an accident in the Alps in Flaine, France, last week, was supervised by his instructor and a member of his family when the accident happened,\" Damnee announced. \"The investigation has shown no sign of negligence or dereliction of duty on the part of the school, or any other party involved.\" Carwyn's family has described him as a keen sportsman who was \"extremely excited\" about his first skiing holiday, and have asked for privacy as they mourn his tragic death. The community has rallied around the family, and a fundraising campaign for their support has already raised thousands of pounds.", "This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you.

The study found that participants who used CEVL for learning the SFU grading system achieved higher scores on post-training evaluations compared to pre-training assessments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the e-Learning technique in this particular context. The results of the multi-institutional trial showed that CEVL has the potential to significantly improve the teaching of the SFU grading system and other complex concepts in pediatric urology.", "These data implicate ATM as the PIKK that phosphorylates H2AX in response to DNA damage caused by CS. Based on current understanding of ATM activation, expression and localization, these data would suggest that, in addition to inducing potentially carcinogenic DSB lesions, CS may also trigger other types of DNA lesions and cause chromatin alterations. As checkpoint kinase (Chk) 1, Chk2 and the p53 tumor suppressor gene are known to be phosphorylated by ATM, the present data indicate that exposure to CS may lead to their phosphorylation, with the downstream consequences related to the halt in cell cycle progression and increased propensity to undergo apoptosis. Defining the nature and temporal sequence of molecular events that are disrupted by CS through activation and eventual dysregulation of normal defense mechanisms such as ATM and its downstream effectors may allow a more precise understanding of how CS promotes cancer development.", "Person1: Great!

John, 71, had been candid about his wife's diagnosis and her struggles, even penning a book about the subject in hopes of raising awareness and helping others in similar situations. The couple, married for over 30 years, had also spoken openly about their devotion to each other, with John referring to their union as a \"marriage made in heaven.\" Friends, family, and fans alike are mourning the loss of Bonnie as they remember her grace, strength, and the love she and her husband shared. John Suchet first rose to fame in the 1970s as a newsreader for ITN, where he remained for several decades. Most recently, he has hosted a popular radio program on Classic FM, where he shares his passion for classical music with listeners across the UK. In 2018, John released a book titled \"My Bonnie: How Dementia Stole the Love of My Life,\" in which he detailed their lives, love, and the challenges they faced as Bonnie's health declined. The book poignantly captured the trials faced by the couple and offered a glimpse into the everyday life of a caregiver. Throughout Bonnie's illness, John remained devoted to his wife and dedicated much of his time to raising awareness and advocating for dementia research and support. His openness and honesty about their journey has been praised by countless fans and fellow caregivers, as it shed light on the often hidden struggles that come with a dementia diagnosis. While Bonnie's passing has brought immense sadness to John and their loved ones, her legacy will live on through the powerful love story they shared, and the vital conversations they helped to open up around dementia care and support.", "Enlarged left atrium can be considered a predictor of poor prognosis in patients after myocardial infarction, as it is often associated with a higher risk of developing adverse events, such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or even death. However, it might not be considered a simple and strong predictor by itself, as prognosis depends on various factors, including the extent of the myocardial infarction, presence of other comorbidities, and the patient's overall health status. It is important to take a multifactorial approach in assessing prognosis in these patients, including evaluating left atrial size along with other clinical and echocardiographic parameters.", "This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her \"Follow Me\" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. That serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. As it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. The ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss just babbles on and on. The ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilitiesimpossibilities that I won't describe.

But we're open to discovering some lesser-known places as well. Person1: You're going to have an amazing time! How long do you plan to be away? Person2: We're thinking about spending around three weeks there, so we can truly immerse ourselves in the culture and see everything we want. Person1: That's a good amount of time. Are you booking through a travel agency or planning it all yourself? Person2: We're using a travel agency for the main itinerary, but we'll also have some free days to explore on our own.

Nevertheless, it's refreshing to see that the newly-released film, \"Bright Laughs,\" shines as a beacon of hope amidst these dark times for comedy lovers. The quirky director Jane Doe has managed to induce genuine laughs by cooking up a delectable concoction of wit, sharp insights, and lovable characters that rub off their bright aura to the audience. The innovative script challenges the intelligence of its viewers as it demands a keen ear and discerning mind, proving that humor can, and should, cater to the intellectual aspect of one's being. The ensemble of talented actors delivers a stellar performance that leaves a lingering, wistful smile on our faces long after the end credits have rolled. The effortless chemistry between the leads, Marla Johnson and Jake Hill, is as delightful as it is inspiring, as it serves as a testament to the magic that occurs when true talents collide. \"Bright Laughs\" provides a much-needed respite from the hackneyed and hollow humor that has plagued the comedy genre for far too long. From its gut-wrenching, tear-inducing laughs to the subtle moments of sweet, heartfelt poignancy, this film is a must-watch for anyone seeking an uplifting and fulfilling comedic experience.", "Police Discover Five Men Hiding in Truck After 200-Mile Journey Across the UK Police stopped a truck this morning after it had travelled 200 miles across the UK, only to discover a group of men hiding inside a small space within it. It is believed that the men had climbed on board the vehicle in Belgium before entering Britain. The truck was stopped by a police sniffer dog team, who found the five men cramped inside. It is unclear at this time if the driver of the truck was aware of the men's presence aboard his vehicle. This incident comes just days after the illegal camp in Calais, France was closed down. The camp, known as the \"Jungle,\" had been a home to numerous migrants attempting to enter the UK. Many of these migrants had previously attempted such dangerous and illegal crossings in an effort to reach British soil. Authorities are currently investigating the matter, and it has yet to be determined if any charges will be filed in relation to the men discovered inside the truck. The men's nationalities have not been released at this time. The closure of the Calais camp has raised concerns that incidents such as this may become increasingly common, with individuals resorting to increasingly desperate measures to enter the UK. Law enforcement agencies are working diligently to intercept any potential illegal crossings, but the ultimate effects of the camp's closure on human smuggling activity remain to be seen.", "Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction.

If you didn't know about the mad theories, you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector.The film-makers have cast Darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice. Even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising, it wasn't interesting to watch. Maybe great thinkers are dull people? I don't know what I was expecting: a forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian, the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow? A long-haired hermit who babbled to animals? A head-cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great. This is the movies for Scorsese's sake.But there was none of that. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe.

Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, the film is a haunting and visceral adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novella, \"Heart of Darkness.\" Sheen delivers a captivating performance as Captain Willard, a man driven to the edge of sanity in his pursuit of the enigmatic Kurtz, played brilliantly by Marlon Brando. Hopper, as the manic and paranoid photojournalist, adds an eerie layer to the already tense atmosphere. The film's visual and auditory experience, from the mesmerizing helicopter attack to the rhythmic sound of the jungle, draws the viewer into the nightmarish world Coppola has created. While some critics argue that the film's pacing is slow, it is the deliberate unravelling of the characters' psyches that serves as the backbone of \"Apocalypse Now.\" It is through this exploration that the audience is confronted with the hard-hitting reality of the dark, murky depths of human soul, unveiling the horrors and absurdity of war. In conclusion, \"Apocalypse Now\" is a powerful and unforgettable movie experience that stands as one of the greatest war films of all time. The phenomenal performances from Sheen, Hopper, and Brando woven into Coppola's masterful direction make this a must-see for any film enthusiast.", "These results demonstrate that proper level of p23 expression is critical for neuronal function, and perturbing p23 function by overexpression initiates a cascade of cellular reactions in brainstem that leads to severe motor deficits and other neurological problems, which culminate in premature death.

Jury members are expected to hear closing statements on Tuesday before reaching a verdict on Hernandez's alleged role in the shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. Defense lawyers called a total of five witnesses over the course of the five-hour hearing, which came to an end at around 3 pm. The first witness, a doctor, gave testimony on behalf of Hernandez's co-defendants, who are charged with being on the hallucinogenic drug PCP at the time of Lloyd's murder. Prosecutors, who argue that Hernandez orchestrated the shooting in June 2013, have spent two months presenting more than 100 pieces of evidence to support their case. Hernandez, who was with the Patriots at the time of Lloyd's death, is one of three men charged with the murder. He is pleading not guilty to all charges.

While the concept of a manhunt for the most feared dictator is enthralling, the execution is lackluster. Pidgeon tries his best to carry the film with his charisma but falls short in the face of uneven pacing, unconvincing supporting characters, and wildly inaccurate historical elements. The film starts off strong, with Pidgeon's character being recruited by British Intelligence for this secret mission due to his sharpshooting skills. However, upon arriving in Germany, the plot begins to meander. The film wastes valuable time showcasing extraneous subplots that bear no relevance to the main story. The budding romance between Pidgeon's character and a local German woman feels forced and distracts from the primary objective. Furthermore, the supporting cast leaves much to be desired. The bond between Pidgeon's character and his fellow operative is not effectively conveyed, making their partnership feel superficial and hollow. Additionally, the film's depiction of Hitler, portrayed as an incompetent buffoon, does not elicit the sense of urgency and danger required for this clandestine operation. \"The Fuhrer's Prey\" is further marred by blatant historical inaccuracies, undermining its credibility as a WWII spy thriller. These inaccuracies not only detract from the viewing experience but are also insulting to the actual events and legacies of those involved in WWII. Despite Pidgeon's laudable performance, \"The Fuhrer's Prey\" is ultimately an unsatisfying and disengaging film. The potentially thrilling narrative is squandered by poor pacing, weak supporting characters, and a lack of respect for historical accuracy. One can only hope that future films with similar premises will learn from this disappointment and succeed where \"The Fuhrer's Prey\" falters.", "Yes, tRPM channels are required for rhythmicity in the ultradian defecation rhythm of C. elegans.

Studies show that increasing stimulations or click rates can lead to reduced neural response amplitudes and longer latencies in auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). These effects may be due to the refractory period of neurons, which is the time it takes for a neuron to recover and be able to fire another action potential. Monaural stimulation, or presenting the stimulus to one ear, typically results in a more robust ABR compared to binaural stimulation, where the stimulus is presented to both ears. In general, the ABR is sensitive to binaural interactions, and click rate can influence these interactions. When the click rate increases, the neural responses tend to decrease in amplitude and become less synchronous, which can make it more difficult to process complex auditory information, such as speech. Some studies suggest that high click rates can suppress the brain's binaural processing abilities, which are critical for sound localization and spatial hearing. However, the effect of high click rate on binaural processing could also be dependent on factors such as the specific click rate used, duration of stimulus presentation, and participant population being studied. Further research is needed to better understand the cumulative effects of high click rates on monaural and binaural processing in the human auditory brainstem.", "Grabbed my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half long (it's nearing 4 am here), and because it's Norwegian, which I wanted to follow up with Dead Snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now. A droll and deliciously wry romp, this movie features a man, Andreas, who gets shipped out to some Purgatory of a Brave New World city, where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal. Driven to the edge by his lack of common senses, he feels nearly ready to kill himself.After an hilarious botched attempt at latter, Andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates. The two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see. But of course, in fantasy allegory land, desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end Andreas' attempt at freedom and sensuality.Jens Lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward movement to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging. The similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating, but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than The Passion of the Christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray-toned mise-en-scene. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings, which works very well.

But everything changes when the landlady of the Thames side pub he frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer Charles Dickens is found. As he digs deeper into both mysteries, he is plunged further into mystery and danger than he bargained for.In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with his gangster cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Okay, no one was blown away by his acting ability, but his presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy. But it all proved to be a one hit wonder, and all he really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed actors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before descending into the realm of straight to DVD hell, the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller, which might have been okay had he not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart from maybe being a one trick pony) is anyone's guess (a dodgy personal life being a possible guess) but here he is.A script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand, but with a miscast looking Jones in the lead, it's even more of a task to fathom. Jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former thesp tramp and Dickens himself talking directly to the camera through-out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too. Add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression.What exactly did I expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail?", "Louis van Gaal's bold recruitment drive appears to be gathering momentum after it emerged that Ilkay Gundogan expects to complete a 15million move to Old Trafford at the end of the season. Despite already re-shaping Manchester United's fortunes and guiding them to third in the Barclays Premier League, ahead of the derby with City, Van Gaal is pressing ahead with plans for more big name signings this summer. Sportsmail revealed last week that Germany centre Mats Hummels has indicated he's finally ready to become a United player, and it now seems it will be as part of a 50m-plus Borussia Dortmund double after Gundogan also gave Van Gaal the go-ahead to bid for his services. Ilkay Gundogan (right) anchors Dortmund's midfield and could be brought in to protect United's defence . Mats Hummels (left) looks likely to join Manchester United this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard . Hummels and Gundogan are likely to be lining up in red for United next year if Van Gaal gets his way . United are believed to have responded to the signal from the Germany midfielder and are confident of agreeing a fee with Dortmund. Both players have been on United's radar for some time, and both have privately let it be known they feel the time has arrived for a fresh start. Dortmund bosses are resigned to Gundogan following Hummels out of the door after the midfield anchorman flatly refused to renew a 100,000-a-week contract that runs out next year and evidently made little secret of his wish to join United. At the age of 26, Hummels (right) has made 39 appearances for Germany and won the World Cup last year . Van Gaal is set to be handed a 150m transfer kitty to further strengthen United in his second year at the club . A powerful figure at the base of Dortmund's midfield, Gundogan might normally have cost a sizeable chunk of Van Gaal's 150m summer budget but could be prised away for as little as 15m, given the time left on his contract.

A daring and provocative adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel that pushes the boundaries and exposes the raw emotions of its characters. This film, directed by the visionary Anne Quirk, cleverly intertwines graphic scenes with an intricate narrative to present a bold, visceral experience that refuses to shy away from the vulnerable and intimate moments of human existence. In portraying Jane Eyre, the young and enigmatic governess, newcomer Isabella Stowe masterfully navigates the fine line between modesty and wantonness, drawing the viewer into her tumultuous journey as she unravels the dark mysteries of Thornfield Hall. Paired with ruggedly handsome Ashton Novak as Mr. Rochester, Stowe and Novak's sizzling chemistry transcends the screen, igniting a fire that will leave fans of the classic story enthralled. Arthouse filmgoers will revel in the beautiful cinematography, thought-provoking symbolism, and meticulously crafted set pieces. However, the significance of the full frontal nudity may be lost on those unfamiliar with the deeper themes of Jane Eyre; presenting themes of vulnerability, societal constraints, and unbridled passion. While some may consider this adaptation a scandalous betrayal of Bronte's original work, others will appreciate its conviction in exploring uncharted territory. The unabashed display of nudity underlines the raw intensity of the story and forces audiences to confront their own prejudices, much as Jane Eyre confronts hers. In summary, Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity is an exhilarating rollercoaster of emotions and carnal desire that will inevitably stir both controversy and admiration. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, those with an appetite for artistic risks will find a cinematic feast for the eyes and soul in this gripping, evocative film.", "Person1: Alright, let me just get your bill together for you.

We conclude that the mean and the variability of the defecation oscillator are separable. Our results support the notion that there is a strong underlying pacemaker which is able to function independently of the observable defecation rhythm and is not perturbed by increases in the variability of the cycle. The interaction of gon-2 and gtl-1 with other components of the oscillator shows that TRPM channels play an important role in the oscillator machinery. Such a role may be through either regulation of cation levels or membrane properties or both. Specifically our results support previous proposals that gon-2 and gtl-1 regulate IP3 signalling and that kqt-3 may act by altering calcium influx.

The locked bike was taken outside an electronics market in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, threatening to put his accomplishment on hold indefinitely. Despite the theft, Wang carried on, determined to see his journey through to the end by completing his ride on foot. However, in a surprising turn of events, local police managed to recover Wang's bicycle against all odds. The stolen bike was returned to its rightful owner, allowing him to continue pedalling towards the completion of his adventure. Wang, 24, had started cycling as a low-impact way of transportation and also to find himself as the only child in his family. His journey quickly transformed into a personal challenge, as he set out to travel through all of China on two wheels. The stolen bike was not simply a means of transportation, but also had sentimental value to Wang after their many miles together. Speaking about the incident, he appealed to the public to help him find his stolen bike. \"At this point, the bike is my second life,\" Wang told local media. \"It has accompanied me through countless hardships. Without the bike, I would not have been able to complete this incredible journey.\" Police found the stolen bike after they saw a man struggling to unlock the bike's unique mechanical lock. Recognizing it from the information provided by Wang, they stopped the thief and successfully recovered the bicycle. \"It is a miracle that the police found my bicycle, and I am truly grateful for their efforts,\" Wang expressed. Following the recovery of his bike, Wang vowed to continue his journey across China, completing the final leg of his epic ride before returning home. With his adventure temporarily halted and now back on track, this incident adds just another story to the already impressive saga of Wang Pingan's cross-country journey.", "Several studies suggest that peripheral nerve injury and TRPV1-expressing primary afferent C-fibers can cause opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In a study conducted on rats with peripheral nerve injury, it was found that there was an increase in BBB permeability in the affected regions. The study also showed that these effects were attenuated by blocking the TRPV1 receptor, which regulates pain perception. Another study revealed that activating TRPV1-expressing primary afferent C-fibers led to increased BBB permeability as well. These findings support the idea that peripheral nerve injury and TRPV1-expressing primary afferent C-fibers can indeed cause the opening of the BBB. It should be noted that more research is needed to fully understand the complexities of this relationship, as well as the implications for potential therapies for neuropathic pain and neurological disorders.", "Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler.

His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film.Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.Along the way of being pursued, Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent.The story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War 11, realism becomes the object of the day.The near-ending scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to.Very interesting that while Pidgeon is fleeing Nazi Germany, he meets up again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon's many co-stars that same year in the memorable \"How Green Was My Valley.\" How green was \"Man Hunt?\"", "I'm glad that I did not expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films. Although it was quite an enormous feat to follow up such a classic, the film decently managed to bring back the characters we all love and cherish, albeit with a modern twist. The visuals, animation, and music were all undoubtedly top-notch, thanks to advancements in technology. Yet, the focus on pop culture references and a more complex storyline seemed to take a toll on the film's original charm that we all grew to love. It's almost as if they tried to cram too much into the movie, leaving it feeling slightly disjointed and lost in the whirlwind of nostalgia. The performances of the voice actors held their ground, staying true to the characters while adding a fresh, contemporary feel. However, the chemistry we once enjoyed between them seemed somewhat diluted in an effort to accommodate the abundance of new characters. The inclusion of these new personalities felt forced and unnecessarily added to the complexity of the plot. Despite its drawbacks, the movie has its moments of laughter and heartwarming scenes that hold special value for longtime fans. Parents with children who are just discovering the story and its characters will certainly create a bond over shared memories and a new appreciation for this world of wonder. In summary, while this sequel may not live up to the magic of its predecessor, it still offers a chance for fans to reconnect with beloved characters, making it worth a watch. Just don't expect to be whisked away in the same way as the original.", "We have physically dissected the anti- and pro-BMP effects of CV2. Its anti-BMP effect is obtained by binding to BMP via subdomain1 of the VWC1 domain, a binding that occurs in competition with Chordin. In contrast, its pro-BMP effect is achieved by direct binding to Chordin via subdomain 2 of VWC1 and VWC2-4. This binding seems to induce conformational changes within the Chordin protein that weaken Chordin's affinity to BMP. We propose that in ternary Chordin-CV2-BMP complexes, both BMP and Chordin are directly associated with CV2, whereas Chordin is pushed away from BMP, ensuring that BMPs can be more easily delivered to their receptors.", "Person1: The fare is 2.50 for adults and 1.25 for children.

Many issues, such as optimal dosing schedules and therapeutic sequences, remain unraveled. At present, treatment should be individualized based on patient- and disease-specific factors. Immunotherapy like ipilimumab still represents the best treatment option for durable remission; however, targeted therapies are more appropriate for patients with BRAF V600-mutated tumor who are symptomatic or have rapidly growing disease. With novel therapeutic options in the pipeline, the role of ipilimumab continues to evolve in the rapidly changing treatment landscape of advanced melanoma. Most likely, this agent will be utilized in combinatorial or sequential approach.", "Isis was removed from the official list of future Pacific hurricane names by the UN's World Meteorological Organization, aWMO spokeswoman announced on Friday. The WMO Hurricane Committeedeemed the name inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group. As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt, Isis had been on the WMO list of names for hurricanes in 2016. Isis was deemed inappropriate and removed from the hurricane list by the UN's World Meteorological Organization.As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt, Isis had been on the WMO list of names for 2016 . The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico's request to retire the name Odile because of the storm (above) ISIS is also used to describe the Islamic State militant group, whose forces have captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria. The group stands accused of committing brutal atrocities against civilians by UN war crimes investigators. Spokeswoman Clare Nullis said from Geneva: 'The Hurricane Committee removed the name Isis from the rotating list and agreed to replace it with Ivette.' 'Names are knocked off the list, which rotates every six years, if they are considered inappropriate if they caused too much damage and too much death.' She added that this was not the case with Isis. The WMO has rotating lists of storm names for various regions that run from A to Z alternating between male and female. The proposal by the WMO regional center was endorsed by the committee. The group, which is composed of experts from 27 member states and territories, was meeting in Costa Rica this week. ISIS stands accused of committing brutal atrocities against civilians by UN war crimes investigators . The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico's request to retire the name Odile and decided on Odalys as its replacement to be used for the 2020 season. Odile hit the popular beach resorts of Baja California last September, stranding thousands of tourists, knocking out power and causing heavy flooding. 'Tropical cyclone activity during the 2014 eastern North Pacific hurricane season was well above normal,' according to the WMO. 'Most of the tropical cyclones formed from tropical waves which moved from the Caribbean Sea to the eastern North Pacific. 'Of the 20 tropical storms that formed, 14 became hurricanes, and eight reached major hurricane strength. 'The hurricane total is the second highest on record for the basin and the number of major hurricanes ties the record for the most. 'By comparison, the averages are 15 tropical storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes.'", "Stimulation threshold in intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) can affect the predictive value of the monitoring. The stimulation threshold is the minimum electrical stimulus required to elicit a response from a nerve. The predictive value of IONM depends on its sensitivity and specificity, which can vary depending on the stimulation threshold, technique used, and the type of surgery. Lower stimulation thresholds may help to identify nerves with greater accuracy, but there could be false positives, which could lower the specificity of IONM. On the other hand, higher stimulation thresholds could lead to potential nerve damage due to strong electrical stimulation. Several studies have shown varying results regarding the optimal stimulation threshold for intraoperative nerve monitoring. Some studies have suggested that higher stimulation thresholds help improve the specificity of IONM without sacrificing sensitivity, while others have found that lower stimulation thresholds might better predict postoperative nerve function. Thus, while stimulation threshold does affect the predictive value of intraoperative nerve monitoring, the optimal threshold setting may differ based on factors such as the type of surgery, technique used, and individual patient characteristics. A tailored approach to determining the stimulation threshold for each patient may help maximize the predictive value of IONM in preventing nerve injury during surgery.", "This is the moment that a crew of firefighters struggled to haul a giant pig out of a garden swimming pool. The prize porker, known as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool. A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'At 4.50pm yesterday the service received a call to a pig stuck in a swimming pool. 'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex . The exhausted animal had to be winched to using an all-terrain crane but appeared no worse for wear after its tumble . 'The crew rescued the pig from the swimming pool using specialist animal rescue slide boards, strops and lines to haul the pig from the swimming pool.' But Pigwig wasn't the only animal who needed rescuing after taking an unexpected swim . Crews in West Sussex were called out to a swimming pool where this time a horse had fallen in. Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool inHeyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land. A fire brigade spokesman said that she appeared none the worse for her impromptu swim after stepping over the edge of the domestic pool.", "Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the USA, \"Duckman\" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons.Unlike the often innocuous criticism found in \"The Simpsons\" (a pretty good show in its own right), and the rude-for-rudeness-sake humour in \"South Park,\" every bit of this series follows a plan. The criticism of US society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series.The cultural references in \"Duckman\" also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). In that, it is different from \"The Simpsons,\" which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff often hidden in \"Duckman.\" As other people writing about it notice, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like \"The Once and Future Duck\" You'll love her until the end of your days... and in \"Bev Takes a Holiday\" (when he takes a chance to tell Beverly all those things he couldn't tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality.One can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness.All in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the USA and one of the best series ever.

The end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star's typical slapstick (and sentimentality) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of her fickle character.The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating would have it and, if anything, is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979] both of which, incidentally, I've only just watched); towards the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking!

Albion are eight points clear of Rangers but suffered their heaviest defeat under Tony Pulis, despite Victor Anichebe's second-half header, and also had Youssouf Mulumbu sent off. Pulis added: 'We should have dealt better with their first goal. The second goal was from a set play.

This musical drama, directed by Alan Parker, not only offers memorable songs, but it also tells a heartwarming story of a group of students who attend New York City's High School of Performing Arts. The movie is both educational and inspiring, as it takes viewers on a journey through the lives of these talented youngsters who dream of achieving fame and success in their respective fields. The diverse cast, featuring Irene Cara, Lee Curreri, and Laura Dean, among others, brings an incredible amount of energy and passion to their roles, making it easy for audiences to root for their character's success. What sets Fame apart from any other musical is the realism portrayed within the story. It demonstrates how the pursuit of fame and success requires endless hours of hard work, dedication, and sometimes heartbreaking sacrifices. This film does not shy away from depicting the struggles, disappointments, and setbacks that each student faces on their path to success. The musical numbers are the icing on the cake, as they add an extra layer of excitement and emotion to the film. Tracks like \"Out Here on My Own\" and the iconic, Academy Award-winning title song, \"Fame,\" have not only become earworms for many, but also serve as anthems for anyone pursuing their dreams in the entertainment industry. Fame is a timeless classic that has aged gracefully over the years, remaining relevant and appreciated by both new and old generations alike. It is an honest, unfiltered portrayal of the highs and lows that come with the pursuit of fame, making it a must-watch for anyone hoping to succeed in the world of performing arts.", "The individual learning abilities and long-term memory of goats highlighted in our study suggest that domestication has not affected goat physical cognition. However, these cognitive abilities contrast with the apparent lack of social learning, suggesting that relatively intelligent species do not always preferentially learn socially. We propose that goat cognition, and maybe more generally ungulate cognition, is mainly driven by the need to forage efficiently in harsh environments and feed on plants that are difficult to access and to process, more than by the computational demands of sociality. Our results could also explain why goats are so successful at colonizing new environments.", "Person1: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you with information about personal loans for your overseas study.

I also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. Charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. The first film had some good music, but the music in this film was unmemorable. In short, this film just did not do it for me.

That's probably the highest praise one could offer for this underwhelming film experience. The plot was thinner than water, and the dreadful acting only served to emphasize the lackluster script. It's hard to say which of the characters was the most one-dimensional, but the movie certainly left us with nothing to care about in their various intertwining storylines. The cinematography, although visually impressive at times, also failed to make any major impact on the story. It almost felt as if the director tried to use beautiful shots to mask the emptiness of the actual content. The jingle, however, did manage to break through the mediocrity with its catchy, foot-tapping tune and provided some respite from the tedium that beset the rest of the film. Visually, the film could have had a chance to impress, but it was plagued with pacing issues and inconsistent tone. It occasionally teased us with moments of what could have been brilliance, but these were quickly eclipsed by the overall lack of substance. In a year with so many other great releases, it's disappointing to see a film with such potential left to wither on the creative vine. It's no wonder Tim Finn's jingle stands out as the film's one high note: it's really the only part that made us feel anything at all. Overall, the movie doesn't leave a lasting impression unless you count leaving you feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. The only consolation is that you'll find yourself humming that catchy jingle by Tim Finn for days to come.

However, one lawmaker criticised the agreement, describing it as \"dancing with the devil.\" The agreement between Iran and Australia has come amid increased concern over ISIS influence within the country, with estimates indicating several dozen Australians have joined the terrorist group in Syria and Iraq. The foreign minister aims to limit further recruitment by focusing on Australian citizens who have joined ISIS and potentially stop them from carrying out terrorist activities upon their return. However, the deal has already attracted its fair share of criticism from within the Australian government. Some argue that collaborating with Iran, a nation with a history of association with terrorist organizations and currently under significant economic sanctions, could create more problems than solutions. An unnamed Australian lawmaker described the agreement by saying, \"We are dancing with the devil.\" Despite the criticism, the foreign minister expressed confidence in the deal, stating that both nations had shared goals in stopping the spread of terrorism and that combined intelligence efforts would result in significant progress.

Eleven suspected illegal immigrants were arrested last week after they were seen clinging to a moving lorry last week. The group, believed to be from Syria, were arrested on the M20 motorway near Folkestone, Kent, on suspicion of illegal entry into Britain after they were seen riding on top of the vehicle by a fellow driver. It is the latest in a series of similar incidents after French authorities began dealing with huge numbers of migrants who have set up camp in Calais and are desperate to reach Britain .", "We conclude that Neuroglian is necessary to maintain axon advance along axonal substrates, but is not required for initiation of axon outgrowth, axon fasciculation or recognition of correct growth substrates. Expression of Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone is sufficient to promote axon advance and the intracellular region of the molecule is largely dispensable for this function. It is unlikely, therefore, that Nrg acts as a molecular 'clutch' to couple adhesion of F-actin within the growth cone to the extracellular substrate. Rather, we suggest that Neuroglian mediates sensory axon advance by promoting adhesion of the surface of the growth cone to its substrate. Our finding that stalling of a pioneer sensory neuron is rescued by driving Neuroglian in sensory neurons alone may suggest that Neuroglian can act in a heterophilic fashion.", "Well, I guess I know the answer to that question. \"Is 'Dive Into Serenity' worth watching?\" My answer is a resounding yes! The director, Sophie Gardener, crafted a beautiful and emotional journey set against the backdrop of an enchanting underwater world. In this 90-minute drama, the viewers delve into the life of Emma, a young woman struggling with grief and seeking solace by immersing herself in scuba diving. The way Gardener captured each dive sequence was breathtaking, with the clear blue waters and vibrant marine life providing an ethereal setting where Emma could truly escape her pain. Meredith Simmons' portrayal of Emma was outstanding. Her vulnerable yet determined demeanor captivated the audience from start to finish. The supporting cast also gave solid performances, with each character helping Emma navigate through her healing journey. The score created an atmospheric ambiance that enhanced the emotional depth of the film. Each scene was perfectly complemented by the haunting melodies that washed over the audience like gentle waves. One criticism some might have is that the pacing of the film might be slow for those who prefer action-packed blockbusters. However, this slower pace allows for a more contemplative experience and allows the audience to fully immerse themselves in the emotional struggles of the character. In conclusion, \"Dive Into Serenity\" is a must-watch for those who seek a beautiful and emotional journey into the depths of both the sea and the human heart. Sophie Gardener has created a truly mesmerizing experience that will leave a lasting impression.", "Yes, genetic context plays a role in determining susceptibility to intraocular pressure elevation in a mouse pigmentary glaucoma model. Studies have shown that mice with certain genetic backgrounds are more prone to developing elevated intraocular pressure and subsequently, pigmentary glaucoma. However, it is important to note that genetic context is not the sole determinant, as other factors such as environment and overall health may also contribute to the development of the disease.", "Argentina has condemned the UK's \"illegitimate\" exploration of oil around the Falkland Islands, leading to angry public comments from British foreign secretary as well asthe Argentinian Cabinet Chief, who is responsible for the intelligence services. Buenos Aires argued that the exploration is in breach of its regulations and sovereignty, and it announced plans for a legal challenge, ruling out the potential for violent conflict over the issue. The remarks have sparked a fierce reaction from foreign secretary Philip Hammond, who said: \"the UK government robustly supports the right of the Falkland Islanders to develop their hydrocarbons sector for their economic benefit.\" He added, \"this continuous harassment of the Falkland island's economic development by Argentina is not only disappointing but it's wholly counterproductive because it will actually retard the development of the Falklands hydrocarbons sector...\" Argentina claimsthe British exploration for oil is in breach of its regulations and therefore constitutes an \"illegitimate activity\"as it is ignoring the United Nations resolutions, which \"urge both parties to avoid unilateral actions.\" This row adds further strain to the already tense relationship between Argentina and the UK over the disputed territory of the Falkland Islands.

With the current season well underway, Bayern continue to dominate, holding a 10-point lead at the top of the table, while Dortmund struggles to catch up at 31 points behind their rivals in 10th place. Over the past half-decade, the two teams have been locked in fierce competition for Bundesliga supremacy. Bayern have clinched the championship title four times in the last five seasons, including their record-breaking run in 2020, while Dortmund managed to secure it in 2019 after a thrilling end to the season. This season, Bayern are once again establishing themselves as the team to beat, with 48 points from 20 games. Led by head coach Hansi Flick, the team has displayed a clinical and relentless approach to winning games, overpowering opponents with their precise tactics and star-studded line-up. Key players such as Robert Lewandowski, Joshua Kimmich, and Thomas Muller have contributed significantly to Bayern's success, with Lewandowski leading the league's scoring charts with 24 goals. Dortmund, on the other hand, have not been able to match their rivals' consistency and find themselves trailing in 10th place, with 17 points from 20 games. Even though their attacking flair and young talents, including Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho, have made them an exciting team to watch, a lack of depth and experience in the squad has made it difficult for them to be a strong title contender this season. The ongoing battle at the top of the Bundesliga has cemented the legacy of the two clubs in German football. Bayern and Dortmund have long been regarded as the powerhouses of the league, and their shared domination of the last five titles is a testament to their sustained excellence. With the current season proving to be another chapter in their heated rivalry, fans are eager to see if their extraordinary performances on the pitch will lead to continued success for both clubs. As the season progresses, Borussia Dortmund will be hoping to gain ground on their rivals and challenge Bayern for the title once again. However, the 24-time German champions, Bayern Munich, seem determined to maintain their dominance and add another Bundesliga trophy to their illustrious collection.", "As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then.The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it. But I have seen many period style dramas on BBC TV and they were well up to the finished standard of this. Just don't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it.In some ways, I found the movie almost going out on a limb to apologise to religious fundamentalists. While it attains a good sense of tension the whole way through, I couldn't help wanting it to get to the publication of The Origin Of Species much quicker than it actually did (you'll wait right until the end for that). And it seemed to dwell much more than I was ever aware on Darwin's struggle with himself and his wife Emma, portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times - which is hardly true. There are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the publication of Origin too, but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty Darwin faced domestically with the book, and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear Darwin tell her the story of a captive orangutan which died of pneumonia. Though, you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with Darwin's daughter.With the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the USA it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it. But to be honest, there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical Godhead. Its hardly headline news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all. But, as fundamental Christians (and many other religions which we're all well aware of) like to wave a placard or two whenever possible, I guess this movie is as good excuse as any. Personally, I cant see what all the fuss is about. But maybe they're just monkeying around...", "A drunken Alaskan man was arrested after he stole a forklift to retrieve his pickup truck which he'd crashed. Aleksandr Glushko, 21, of Delta Junction drove for more than three mileswhile intoxicated to retrieve the truck he'd just crashed. But his bright idea turned sour when an Alaskan Railroad worker spotted him at the wheel of the forklift driving by the crash site, according toThe Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Bad idea: The pickup truck driven by Aleksandr Glushko is pictured here after he crashed it in Fairbanks, Alaska, police said the 21-year-old drove a stolen forklift more than three miles while intoxicated to retrieve it . The railroad worker informed police that he had just seen a man driving a forklift to Illinois Street and the driver had told him he was taking the forklift to get his dad's truck, which had a flat tire. However, he was arrested by police who were at the scene when he looped back.He has been charged with a felony for driving under the influence of alcohol. According to police, the bizarre incident unfolded just before 6 a.m. Monday, when Glushko drove off the road in a pickup and crashed into pipe stacked in a company yard. The pickup was left straddling the pipe. Police said Glushko then walked to George Horner Ice Park, where he stole a forklift and drove off with it. Lieutenant Matt Soden from Fairbanks Police Department told the newspaper: 'Police were on scene talking to the railroad worker when Mr. Glushko came driving back up on the forklift.' Glushko was cooperative and agreed to take a breath-alcohol test. It registered 0.230, almost three times the intoxication standard of 0.08, Soden said.

Footage shows the seven-day-old foal nuzzling Sunny Bayne's shoulder before pushing her to the ground and lying on top of her belly. The young rider from Kentucky can't stop smiling at the animal's silly antics. 'This is the best day of my life,' she exclaims as the cuddling session continues. The pony appears completely at ease and he stretches out his legs in a bid to further his relaxation. 'Look at him,' Bayne says to the camera as she pets the pony's brown coat. Finally, after almost a minute, the creature decides he's had enough and he gets back up to four hooves. Another adult horse is seen on the sidelines watching the heartwarming petting session unfold.

It's out there. Really warped little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry. Neat treat with all the cameos too. If you want something \"different,\" look no further.", "The greatest movie ever.How's that for a contention? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. As a discussion into human morality, Three Colours Red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that none can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was better still, but still not quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this movie, is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he expresses is how it is to feel human. It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. In Red, one may find meaning on one of its several levels. On the first level, Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie. It is as if Kieslowski is saying: \"Ceci n'est pas la realite.\" In effect, in pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double Vie de Veronique, but not until this, his final film, did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate, philosophy and circumstance. The actors and actresses, too, appear to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Irene Jacob), is aptly name, for she seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant's Judge Kern, a cantankerous man, who, by the end, becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy, a power which he could only achieve through Valentine.We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. It won't happen, of course, but at least we have the power to view this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define, but all possess. A synopsis of this film read: \"A film about a woman who runs over a dog.\" Well, it is.Isn't it?-Simon Huxtable", "Reproductive rates in Australian rodents can be related to phylogeny to some extent, as closely related species may have similar reproductive traits. The evolution of reproductive strategies in rodents can be influenced by factors like habitat, diet, and predation pressure, which can vary across different species and geographical ranges. However, phylogeny alone may not sufficiently explain the full range of variation in reproductive rates among Australian rodents. Other factors, such as ecological and environmental factors, can also play a significant role in shaping the reproductive strategies of these animals. Studies on specific rodent species or communities in Australia are necessary to make more robust conclusions about the relationship between reproductive rates and phylogeny in Australian rodents.", "Generation 2015 Youth Panel member, Gareth Shoulder, makes controversial remarks about David Cameron on Twitter A member of the Generation 2015 Election Youth Panel, Gareth Shoulder, has come under fire after making a disparaging remark about former Prime Minister David Cameron and his deceased son Ivan on Twitter. The 24-year-old was speaking in his own capacity, a BBC spokesman said. Shoulder was selected to be part of the Generation 2015 youth campaign, which aimed to engage young people in political discussions and debates in the lead up to the general election that year. The panel featured a group of 200 youngsters, aged between 18-24, from various backgrounds and political affiliations, who contributed opinions and ideas to a wide range of media outlets. The tweet, which has since been deleted, has been met with widespread condemnation from fellow Twitter users, who labelled Shoulder's comment as insensitive and disrespectful. The BBC, whilst they did not endorse Shoulder's tweet, did release a statement confirming he was not speaking on behalf of the organization or the Generation 2015 panel. David Cameron has not directly commented on the matter, however, a source close to the former Prime Minister suggests that he would prefer that the focus remains on more pressing political issues rather than dwell on offensive remarks on social media. Critics of Shoulder's action have been using the incident to question the impact and role of online platforms in political debates, particularly in relation to spreading hate speech and promoting negative discourse.", "Some people may remember Ms. Russell from films such as \"Black Widow,\" which had some appeal and critical acclaim. In her latest film, \"Crimson Shadows,\" she truly outdoes herself in a masterful performance that elevates the entire movie and leaves the audience captivated. Set in a picturesque New England town, \"Crimson Shadows\" weaves together a thrilling narrative with compelling characters and intriguing twists. Russell's portrayal of the intelligent yet complex Elizabeth, a woman struggling with the dark secrets of her past, is nothing short of phenomenal. Her ability to convey the raw emotions of a character teetering on the edge of a psychological breakdown is captivating and serves as the lifeblood of the film. The supporting cast, including the talented John Wilson as Detective Andrews, effortlessly brings the story to life with their authentic and genuine performances. The chemistry between Russell and Wilson, in particular, adds depth to the narrative as they attempt to unravel the mysterious events unfolding in their once peaceful town. Director Philip Stratton's decision to shoot the film on location adds a layer of authenticity to the movie, and the stunning cinematography perfectly captures the unsettling beauty of the environment. The striking contrast between the idyllic scenery and the dark undertones of the story creates a chilling atmosphere that keeps the audience enthralled. The nuanced script, with its carefully crafted dialogue and suspenseful pacing, keeps the viewers on their toes, constantly guessing what will happen next. The story remains engaging throughout and avoids the pitfalls of predictability that often plague films within the thriller genre. Overall, \"Crimson Shadows\" is a remarkable film that showcases Ms. Russell's spectacular acting talents, a captivating storyline, and stunning cinematography. A must-see for fans of psychological thrillers and a testament to the power of storytelling on the silver screen.", "Yes, selective blockade of vasopressin V2 receptors can reveal significant V2-mediated water reabsorption in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus. Brattleboro rats have a genetic mutation that results in a lack of vasopressin production, leading to diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by polyuria (excessive urination) and polydipsia (excessive thirst). Vasopressin V2 receptors, primarily located in the collecting ducts of the kidneys, are associated with regulating water reabsorption. Studies have shown that when V2 receptors are selectively blocked in Brattleboro rats using V2 receptor antagonists, their urine output increases, and their urine becomes more diluted. This demonstrates that there is still some V2-mediated water reabsorption taking place in these rats, which would otherwise have been masked by the background of diabetes insipidus. However, one must note that although V2 receptor blockade can reveal this effect, it does not fully restore normal water reabsorption or reverse diabetes insipidus in Brattleboro rats. Other treatments, such as hormone replacement with synthetic vasopressin analogs, might be needed for that purpose.", "Person1: Where are you going, Jane?

The visuals burst with vibrant colors reminiscent of Seuss' illustrations, and the clever characters perfectly capture the whimsical nature of the story. The plot stays faithful to the source material while adding enough creative enhancements that keep just the right balance between nostalgic and refreshing. The voice acting is truly outstanding, with the actors wonderfully bringing Seuss' famous rhymes to life, making the dialogue engaging for both children and adults alike. The humor is sharp and smart, filled with subtle references that cater to audiences of all ages. The story moves at a brisk pace, keeping viewers fully immersed without overwhelming them with flashy effects or over-the-top gags. The animation, as mentioned, is stellar. It's a perfect blend of innovative technology and traditional hand-drawn techniques that honor the original book while bringing a breath of fresh air to the screen. The color palette is a visual treat, with each scene brimming with rich hues of every shade imaginable. The character designs are spot-on, staying true to Seuss' imaginative style while putting the studio's own distinctive spin. What truly makes this adaptation stand out is its ability to balance morals and entertainment. The film cleverly weaves in important life lessons without coming across as preachy, making the story enjoyable for everyone. It's a movie that both children and parents can appreciate, sparking meaningful conversations about values and self-discovery after watching it together. In conclusion, this film deserves all the praise and accolades it has garnered. It's a respectful and modern adaptation of a classic book, filled with wit, charm, and plenty of heart. This animated classic is a must-watch for fans of Dr Seuss and newcomers alike, proving once again that timeless stories can be successfully adapted for new generations to come.", "Yes, family donors can be critical and legitimate in developing countries for several reasons: 1. Financial support: In developing countries where government support and funds for various programs may be limited, family donors can provide financial assistance to help cover essential expenses such as education, food, healthcare, and housing. 2. Building social cohesion: Family donors play a significant role in strengthening social ties and fostering a sense of community. Through their contributions, family donors demonstrate responsibility for one another and a commitment to shared values. 3. Strengthening the local economy: As family donors provide financial assistance to their relatives, they are also contributing to the local economy. Money spent on goods and services helps strengthen the economic structure of a community. 4. Promoting entrepreneurship: Family donors can help to fund small businesses and entrepreneurial projects, promoting job creation, and economic development within the community. 5. Tackling poverty: Family donors provide critical support to members of their community who struggle with poverty. Their financial aid can help alleviate some immediate burdens, providing access to essential services and enabling recipients to work towards self-reliance. However, it's important to note that family donors should not be seen as the sole solution to development challenges.

The plot was a confusing mess that left the audience scratching their heads, the characters were one-dimensional, and the dialogue was filled with cliches and cheesy lines. The pacing was slow and the runtime felt much longer than it actually was. To top it all off, the acting was an absolute nightmare, with wooden performances and forced chemistry. Not even the special effects could save this film from its imminent demise, as they were poorly executed, and at times, completely laughable. I am convinced that the only reason it even made it to the big screen is because it had a star-studded cast that promised revenue.

It was only 10 minutes into the hour-long debate when Abraham was heard falling as Senator Anthony Williams answered a question, and the camera panned over to see the former Philadelphia District Attorney lying helpless on the floor. Mayoral candidate Nelson Diaz quickly came to Abraham's aide and helped her stand up when she regained consciousness. Scroll down for video .

The debate was paused as a doctor evaluated Abraham backstage and told her she probably suffered from a sudden drop in blood pressure due to the unforgiving stage lights. While Abraham was anxious to get back on stage and finish the debate, the doctor ordered her against returning. Speaking to reporters after her fall, Abraham said she wasembarrassedbut feeling well and that the incident won't impact her campaign. 'How'd you like my opening act?' Abraham joked to reporters.

She said she has never fainted before. 'It just happened at an inopportune time. It's a little bitembarrassingbut I fell gracefully. I didn't hurt anything I'mfine,' she said.

With just 11 days left before the match, dubbed the 300 million fights, the spectacle has become shrouded in controversy due to a recent YouTube video mocking Pacquiao. The video in question features American boxer Jeremy \"J Flash\" Nichols impersonating Manny Pacquiao during a mock interview. Nichols' impersonation targets various aspects of Pacquiao's personal and professional life, including his accent, singing career, and strong Christian faith. In the video, 'J Flash' also claims that the Filipino boxing icon attributes some of his success to his mother's use of Voodoo chants. Despite this incident and the high-profile build-up, many fans have been left stunned by the lack of available tickets so close to the much-anticipated event. With less than two weeks to go before Mayweather and Pacquiao battle it out in the ring, it seems the delay is due to a still unresolved issue regarding ticket distribution between the MGM Grand and the various promoters. Soon, however, these behind-the-scenes dramas will be pushed aside as attention focuses on the fight itself.

The incident occurred as fists, metal poles, and chairs flew through the air while rival gangs clashed in the packed gambling hall. According to witnesses, the fight reportedly broke out at around 10:30 pm after two women argued in a line. The brawl quickly escalated, involving hundreds of patrons as gangs tore around the premises. Security guards and NYPD officers were called to control the escalating chaos. \"I saw fists flying, chairs were flying - even metal poles that you secure the lines with, someone was swinging those around,\" said Harold Mendez, a 21-year-old who was on the casino floor when the fight broke out. As the brawl carried on, video footage captured by horrified bystanders showed hundreds of people thrashing and wrestling to the floor. In the aftermath of the large-scale confrontation, three people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and assault. It is unclear if the two women involved in the initial clash were among those arrested.

I admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away, but this is by no means a creative work of art. It's pure shock value.On the upside, it makes the Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.", "These data strongly suggest that medial SMC loss in allograft arteriopathy occurs by apoptosis. Further, RT-PCR data indicate that cytolytic cell-derived inducers of apoptosis are upregulated in these grafts and may be accountable for medial SMC apoptotic cell death. Finally, fully-disparate (Brown Norway to Lewis) and minor-only incompatible (Lewis to Fisher) strain combinations both resulted in marked intimal proliferation, medial SMC loss by apoptosis, and similar patterns of expression of cytolytic cell derived inducers of apoptosis. Insofar as intimal proliferative lesion-formation may be dependent on medial damage (as in arterial-injury models), understanding the mechanism of medial SMC loss may provide a novel therapeutic approach to human cardiac transplant arteriopathy.", "LeSean McCoy slams former coach, praises new franchise In a recent interview, LeSean McCoy, the 26-year-old running back, criticized his former coach, claiming he doesn't respect star talent. After a day with his new franchise, the versatile player went on to praise them by saying that they have more of an NFL feel than the Eagles who had drafted him in the second round of the 2009 draft. \"I don't think he likes or respects the stars. I'm being honest,\" said McCoy of his former coach. This statement may come as a surprise to some as high-profile players like McCoy are usually diplomatic in their views. However, the dynamic running back has never shied away from speaking his mind, as is evident from various instances in the past. As McCoy starts a new chapter in his career with his new franchise, it will be interesting to see if his former coach's alleged indifference towards star players will have an impact on his performance or if it'll fuel him to succeed and prove his worth.", "(CNN) Britain's Prince Harry arrived Monday in Australia, where he'll be spending four weeks with the country's military. Before reporting for duty, the 30-year-old prince visited the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the capital, paying his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside the memorial. Some snapped photos of the royal visitor, while one boy held a sign celebrating the prince's hair color: \"Red Heads Rule!\" During his time down under, Harry \"will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth,\" the Australian Defence Forces said last week. He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his 10-year military career, according to a royal spokesman. \"Prince Harry has trained and served alongside Australian armed forces on operational tours to Afghanistan; he has met them during the Invictus Games; and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,\" the spokesman said ahead of the visit. The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry is known in the British Army as \"Captain Harry Wales,\" from his official title and name, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales. He began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Last month, he announced that he would be leaving the armed forces in June, describing the decision as \"really tough.\" Australian military officials say the prince's program with them will be \"challenging.\" It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He'll also participate in regular activities such as physical training and pack marches. Another focus of Harry's visit is to spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia. \"Wounded warriors\" are a special interest for Prince Harry. He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. During his attachment with the Australian military, Harry will accompany Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April for commemorations on the anniversary of the World War I Battle of Gallipoli.", "Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. To my delight, this film surpassed my expectations, delivering an exhilarating and emotionally charged adventure that not only introduced me to the characters but also immersed me in their world. The casting was excellent, as each actor embodied their respective character with outstanding precision and charisma. The chemistry between the characters was undeniable, creating an engaging team dynamic that was contagious. I found myself rooting for these heroes in a way that I haven't experienced in quite some time. The plot was well-paced and presented the characters with relatable challenges that tested their abilities and forced them to grow into the heroes they were destined to be. Each character had their time in the spotlight, with their individual story arcs weaving seamlessly together to create an epic adventure. The visual effects and action sequences were breathtaking, leaving me on the edge of my seat and fully immersed in the world these characters were trying to save. The main adversary presented a threat beyond anything I could have anticipated, making the stakes higher and the heroes' triumph all the more satisfying. The film also teases the possibility of a sequel without relying on cliched post-credits scenes. Instead, it left me wanting more, both in terms of character development and world-building. Overall, this film exceeded all expectations, offering a thrilling and engaging experience that stays true to its source material while providing enough originality and excitement to keep even the most uninitiated viewer captivated. Be it a comic book fan or a casual viewer, this film is a must-watch and offers the perfect blend of action, adventure, and heart.", "Yes, joint fluid antioxidants are generally decreased in osteoarthritic joints compared to joints with macroscopically intact cartilage and subacute injury. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the degradation of cartilage and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can cause oxidative stress, which can further damage the cartilage, leading to the progression of osteoarthritis. In normal joints, antioxidant systems help to neutralize the ROS and protect the cartilage from oxidative damage. However, in osteoarthritic joints, the antioxidant defense system can be compromised, leading to decreased levels of joint fluid antioxidants and an imbalance between the production of ROS and the capacity of the joint to neutralize them. Several studies have shown that lower levels of antioxidants, such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase are found in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic joints compared to joints with intact cartilage and subacute injury. This reduction in antioxidants can contribute to increased oxidative stress and cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis, leading to more joint pain and loss of function.", "For a horror film, this is criminally dull. A few memorable, gruesome bits can't compensate for a really poor script. Very little coherence is achieved, and the movie relentlessly overplays its one basic idea (a killer cat), until it becomes repetitive - and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the cat's point-of-view. (12)", "Grade II pancreatic injuries do not require routine surgical exploration in children. Grade III and IV injuries in this series were treated with expeditious drainage of the pancreatic bed and did not require routine pancreatectomy or endoscopic stent [corrected] placement as some have recommended. Early drainage shortens hospital stay, and outcomes from this therapy are excellent. Pancreatic resection of exocrine defunctionalized segments of pancreas may be performed safely electively after acute injury if necessary, but anecdotal information from this series indicates that too may not be necessary. Grade V injuries often are accompanied by multiple other organ injuries and are associated with a significant mortality rate. A multi-institutional investigation is warranted to reassess optimal therapy for pancreatic injury in children.", "Healthy Meals Contain More Fat Than Junk Food A recent analysis of some of the UK's biggest chains has revealed that several apparently healthy meals contain more fat than demonised junk foods. Asda's Piri Piri Chicken Pasta Salad and Caffe Nero's Brie and Bacon Panini are among the products found to have more fat than the infamous junk food alternatives, a Burger King Bacon and Cheese Whopper, and McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Asda's Piri Piri Chicken Pasta Salad contains a shocking 46.5g of fat, exceeding the 43.3g found in a Burger King Bacon and Cheese Whopper. Caffe Nero's Brie and Bacon Panini has 25.4g of fat, surpassing the 24.6g found in a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Experts warn that these seemingly healthy meal options can be deceptive for consumers trying to maintain a balanced diet. The British Nutrition Foundation has suggested that more transparency is needed in the food industry, particularly when it comes to labeling and providing nutritional information. They have also encouraged food manufacturers and retailers to reformulate their recipes to decrease the fat content in their products. This follows Public Health England's announcement that the food industry is compliant with fat reduction targets, set by the UK Government to tackle the country's obesity crisis. As part of the Government's efforts to promote a healthier lifestyle, nationwide programs have been launched to encourage healthier choices and more physical activity. However, the findings of this recent analysis call into question the effectiveness of these measures as consumers are still being deceived into choosing seemingly healthy options that contain high levels of fat. In response to these revelations, a spokesperson for Asda stated: \"Our pasta salads are clearly labeled with the nutritional content and our customers can make an informed choice about whether to purchase them or an alternative product.\" A spokesperson for Caffe Nero similarly said: \"Our panini is made with fresh, quality ingredients and we provide clear nutrition information for our customers on our website and in-store.\" Despite these assurances, questions remain about whether providing nutritional information is enough to tackle the growing culture of unhealthy eating.", "Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I watched it. And I found it hilarious! Aliens, their weird spaceship, their weird helmets... my God, was that a sight. And all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth.And where do they look for it? In upper Bavaria, Germany. And that is where the main fun comes from: In Europe (and more so in German-speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. Well, there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the \"American Pie\" series.But what this film achieved is a true, funny weirdness. You constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas. But it was 1974, and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia. You've never seen a film like that.And if you don't mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts, watch it once. It is a comedy essentially, not a porn flick.", "Yes, environmental perturbation of the circadian clock can potentially disrupt pregnancy in the mouse. Studies have shown that altering the light-dark cycle, exposure to constant light, or genetic disruption of the circadian clock can lead to changes in reproductive cycles, implantation failure, and increased rates of miscarriage in mice. Maintaining stable environmental conditions, including consistent light-dark cycles, is important to ensure proper reproductive function and pregnancy outcomes in mice.", "Yes, muscle power is an important measure to detect deficits in muscle function in hip osteoarthritis. A cross-sectional study can help researchers understand the relationship between muscle power and hip osteoarthritis. By assessing muscle power in individuals with hip osteoarthritis and comparing it to a control group without hip osteoarthritis, researchers can explore the presence of deficits in muscle function and determine if muscle power is a relevant factor in the development or progression of the condition. Their findings can advise physical therapists and other healthcare professionals in developing more effective interventions and treatments for hip osteoarthritis patients.", "Person1: Jimmy, I called you yesterday, but you didn't pick up.

Then, after lunch. We went for a walk along the river and looked at the beautiful view there. Person1: What did you do then? Person2: We had a drink in a bar there and made some friends, we played cards and laughed, then we started to drive home. It took us a long time to arrive home because there was a lot of traffic on the road. Person1: Well, that was a lovely day. Person2: That's right. So why did you call me?

Let me check our room availability and see if we can find a quieter room for you. Can you please let me know your room number and the name the reservation is under?", "Listeners say the last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions on the iPlayer service . It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem 'irritating', 'annoying' and 'frustrating' and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad's Army and Hancock's Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC's own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: 'Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can't be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?' Another added: 'I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.' Shows such as Dad's Army and Hancock's Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes . According to the BBC's own figures, in February this year, 57million 'requests' were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC's Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: 'There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can't humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.'", "Person1: What do you usually do to relieve stress after a long day at work? Person2: Typically, I like to go for a walk or exercise to clear my head. Sometimes I'll also watch a movie or read a book to unwind. How about you?", "It's the ultimate in slow-motion footage. The BBC is to air a two-hour, real-time documentary following a canalboat as it pootles its way along a British waterway at a leisurely 4mph. For many, the languid film will be as interesting as watching paint dry, but the Corporation hopes many viewers will find it a refreshing change from the usual frenetic pace of modern TV. There is no presenter, narrator, dialogue or music, so all viewers will hear are the sounds of the boat's engine, the lapping of the water and the local birdsong as the barge makes its way along a picturesque stretch of the Kennet and Avon Canal. 00.00: And they're off! 0-4mph in ten minutes . 34.07: Bridge over (not at all) troubled water . 41.50: Crazy boy racers scream past at 5mph . Aside from two aerial cutaway shots, when the boat negotiates a lock and crosses the Dundas Aqueduct, the full two hours is shot continuously from a single camera on the front of the boat. Rather incongruously, it's the same specialist high-definition equipment used to shoot the action-packed James Bond blockbuster Skyfall. In contrast, the most exiting moments of All Aboard! The Canal Trip involve the narrowboat being overtaken by a swan, or having to manoeuvre out of the way of a pleasure craft. Other exciting scenes feature a plank of wood, a dog-walker and cyclists on the towpath. The film was shot on a sunny day last month and will air on May 5 as part of the BBC Four Goes Slow series of deliberately unrushed programmes. Producer Luke Korzun Martin said: 'We want the voyage to feel like a sensory experience. We want it to be mesmeric, hypnotic and beautiful. 'The idea was to create a moving painting. It is like a Constable landscape which changes in front of your eyes. If people are going to sit and watch a two-hour single shot, it needs to be the most beautiful two-hour shot it can be.' Rob Dean, of the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust, said: 'I think this is the right approach. The whole point about the waterways is they slow people down.' 55.40: Mayday! Mayday!

Leo, a Staffordshire-Boxer cross, set the ground-floor kitchen alight after he managed to switch on the cooker while hunting for food. Leo's antics led to a third of the ground-floor of the property being significantly damaged. The reason why the mischievous canine inadvertently caused such a disastrous fire was due to a child's car seat left on top of one of the hob's rings. The car seat subsequently caught fire after the dog unknowingly switched the hob on, leading to the blaze quickly spreading throughout the kitchen and causing extensive damage. Firefighters later confirmed that the car seat left on the hob increased the likelihood of the extreme destruction. A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said, \"Never leave anything on the cooktop other than pots and pans when cooking, even when the hob is not in use, as we never know when a pet could accidentally switch it on.\" The London Fire Brigade arrived on the scene after receiving a call about the incident, and their prompt action and response ensured that the fire did not spread to other parts of the property. Fortunately, the family members and the pet dog, Leo, were able to escape from the home safe and unharmed. The homeowners have been reminded of the dangers of placing any items on top of their cookers and the importance of monitoring their pet's movements to minimize risk. As winter approaches, the London Fire Brigade urges the public to remain vigilant and pay attention to fire safety in their homes. With the increase in usage of heating appliances during the colder months, extra care should be taken to ensure that accidents like this do not occur.", "Person1: Hello Person2: Hi Angela, it's Dan.

Manchester City may have big plans to revamp the team in the summer, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri among the high-profile casualties, but what if Liverpool reel them in over the next six matches? City are four points clear and have a superior goal difference, which equates to five, yet undoubtedly they are vulnerable. For a team playing this poorly no run-in is easy and matches against the much-improved Aston Villa and even Queens Park Rangers can no longer be viewed with certainty. Yaya Toure (centre) has been a shadow of the player who fired Manchester City to last season's title . Manuel Pellegrini (second right) trudges off the pitch after Manchester City were beaten by Crystal Palace . Future opponents Swansea City and Southampton have little to play for - yet neither did Crystal Palace. The long-term plan is plain: Pep Guardiola, at his convenience, probably in 2016. Yet where will City be by then? An overhaul of playing personnel is due, but there has been scant evidence Manuel Pellegrini or director of football Txiki Begiristain are adept at identifying replacements. Eliaquim Mangala was supposed to be a different class to Joleon Lescott, but the Premier League's most expensive defender cannot command a place in the team; Stevan Jovetic is no Carlos Tevez; Fernando no great upgrade on Gareth Barry or Nigel de Jong. Toure is in obvious decline, but his influence on City's two title winning seasons was huge. Can Pellegrini and Begiristain be trusted to find a replacement capable of Toure's impact? Not on the evidence of their recent signings. Jesus Navas? Martin Demichelis? Even Fernandinho is not as good as he was at Shakhtar Donetsk. The powers that be at City are waiting for Pep Guardiola to leave Bayern Munich for Manchester . And what if City are caught and condemned to the Europa League? What happens to this lavish rebuilding plan then? Take away the Champions League money and City's financial capacity is not really much greater than Tottenham's. Pellegrini has performed weakly this season and keeping him on another year while marking time for Guardiola is a giant gamble. Roberto Mancini got City into the elite in the nick of time with the financial fair play regulations about to be introduced. Locked outside, City's capacity to improve would be severely limited. Would Guardiola even come in those circumstances? Great manager he may be, but not one that has shown any burning desire to work off the same budget as Everton.", "MFIOLs continue to evolve to meet the needs of an evolving patient population.
